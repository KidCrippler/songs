Gather round a corner
half a mile from here
See those long trains runnin 
and watch them disappear

Know I saw Mrs. Lucy 
down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family 
and she won't be comin' back

Got the Illinois Central 
and the Southern Central Freight
Got to keep on pushin' mama
you know they're runnin' late

{rythm change}
Well pistons keep on turnin 
and wheels go round and round
And steel rail black cold and hard 
and the miles as they go down
