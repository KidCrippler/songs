Am7
Down around the corner, half a mile from here
See them long trains run, and you watch them disappear
{Rest join}
        Dm7                      Am7
Without love, where would you be now?
        F7  E4   -  E7   -  Am7
Without love...

    Am7
You know I saw miss Lucy down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family and she won't be coming back
        Dm7                            Am7
Without love, where would you be right now?
        F7  E4   -  E7   -  Am7
Without love...

         Am7
Well the Illinois Central
And the Southern Central Freight
Got to keep on pushin' mama
You know they're running late
        Dm7                      Am7
Without love, where would you be now-na-na-now?
        F7  E4   -  E7   -  Am7
Without love...

{Harmonica Solo - same chord progression as one full verse}

         Am7
Well the Illinois Central
And the Southern Central Freight
Got to keep on pushin' mama
You know they're running late
        Dm7                      Am7
Without love, where would you be now?
        F7  E4   -  E7   -  Am7
Without love...

{Rhythm changes}
         Am7
Well the pistons keep on turnin'
And the wheels go round and round
And the steel rails are cold and hard
And the miles as they go down
        Dm7                            Am7
Without love, where would you be right now?
        F7  E4   -  E7   -  Am7
Without love...
Dm7
oohhhhh, where would you be now?
