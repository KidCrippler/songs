  G                                       G
I think I'm gonna be sad   I think it's today, yeah
    G                                    Am     D
The girl that's driving me mad is going away
 Em                   C     Em                    Fmaj7!
She's got a ticket to ride  she's got a ticket to ride
Em                    D                   G       G
She's got a ticket to ride  and she don't care.

    G                                         G
She said that living with me  Is bringing her down, yeah
G                                       Am       D
She would never be free     when I was around

 Em                   C       Em                    Fmaj7!
She's got a ticket to ride    she's got a ticket to ride
Em                    D                   G           G
She's got a ticket to ride  and she don't care.

  C
I don't know why she's riding so high
                                                    D
She ought to think twice   she ought to do right by me
   C
Before she gets to saying goodbye
                                                    D!   D!
She ought to think twice   she ought to do right by me

  G                                       G
I think I'm gonna be sad   I think it's today, yeah
                                         Am   D
The girl that's driving me mad is going away, yeah

 Em                   C     Em                   Fmaj7!
She's got a ticket to ride  she's got a ticket to ride
Em                    D                   G          G
She's got a ticket to ride  and she don't care.

My baby don't care...      My baby don't care...
