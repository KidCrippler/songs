What A Wonderful World - Louis Armstrong

F     C

       F        Am
I see trees of green
Bb           Am
   red roses too
Gm             F
   I see them bloom
A7            Dm
   for me and you
      C#                C#
And I think to myself
Gm7        C         F
    what a wonderful world

(F)     A    Bb    C
 
      F         Am
I see skies of blue 
Bb               Am
   and clouds of white
Gm                     F
    The bright blessed days
A7                  Dm
    the dark sacred nights
      C#                C#
And I think to myself
Gm7        C         F
    what a wonderful world

(F)    Bb    Bb    F

    C              C
The colours of the rainbow
    F            F
so pretty in the sky
    C           C
Are also on the faces
   F            F
of people going by
       Dm             Am
I see friends shaking hands 
Dm                    Am
    saying how do you do
Bb                 Am    
    Theyâ€™re really saying
Gm     C
I love you

       F            Am
I hear babies crying
Bb               Am
   I watch them grow
Gm                    F
   They'll learn much more 
A7                 Dm
   than I'll ever know
      C#                C#
And I think to myself
Gm7        C         F      Eb7   D7
    what a wonderful world
      Gm7            Gm7  
Yes I think to myself
C                   F     Bb   F
   what a wonderful world
