Set Fire To The Rain - Adele

Dm      F       C       Gm
Dm      F       C       Gm
 
         Dm            F
I let it fall,      my heart
          C                  Gm
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
       Dm                   F
It was dark      and I was over
          C                      Gm
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
   Dm                    F
My hands,      they're strong
        C                 Gm
but my knees were far too weak
    Dm                  F
To stand        in your arms 
        C               C
without falling to your feet
 
              Bb                 Gm
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
        Dm                          Dm
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
        Bb                          C                          C
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win
 
          Dm              Dm
But I set fire     to the rain
           C                        C
Watched it pour as I   touched your face
         Gm
Well, it burned while I cried
         Gm                          Dm            C
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,    your name
 
     Dm           F
When lay     with you
         C           Gm
I could stay there, close my eyes
         Dm           F
feel you here      forever
        C                       C
You and me together, nothing is better
 
              Bb                 Gm
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
        Dm                          Dm
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
        Bb                          C                        C
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win
 
          Dm              Dm
But I set fire     to the rain
           C                        C
Watched it pour as I   touched your face
         Gm
Well, it burned while I cried
         Gm                          Dm            C
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,    your name
      Dm              Dm
I set fire     to the rain
            C            C
And I threw us into the flames
        Gm
Well, I felt something die
         Gm                          Dm               C
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, last ti----me

          Bb               F/A
Sometimes I wake up by the door
              Am                       C
And heard you calling, must be waiting for you
     Bb                     F/A
Even now when we're already over
         Am                      C
I can't help myself from looking for you
 
[          Dm              Dm
But I set fire     to the rain
           C                        C
Watched it pour as I   touched your face

Well, it burned while I cried
         Gm                          Dm            C
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,    your name
      Dm              Dm

      Dm              Dm
Ohhhhhhh          
            C            C
        Oh, no
       Gm
Let it burn, oh
         Gm                          Dm               C
                                   
       Dm              Dm
Let it burn

Let it burn
         Gm                          Dm               C
