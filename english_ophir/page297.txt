Hound Dog Chords - Elvis Presley
Lyrics and Music: Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller
                        C
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
 
Cryin' all the time
                        F
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
               C
Cryin' all the time
                G
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
        F                  C
And you ain't no friend of mine

                       C
When they said you was high classed
 
Well, that was just a lie
                       F
Yeah they said you was high classed
                      C
Well, that was just a lie
                G
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
        F                  C
And you ain't no friend of mine

                        C
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
 
Cryin' all the time
                        F
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
               C
Cryin' all the time
                G
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
        F                  C
And you ain't no friend of mine
