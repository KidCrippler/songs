         D
Well Sometimes I go out by myself
                      Em                                               
and I look across the water
       D
And I think of all the things, of what you're doing
                         Em
and in my head I paint a picture

       G
'Cause since I've come home
        F#m
Well my body's been a mess
      G
And I miss your ginger hair
        F#m
and the way you like to dress

G
   Won't you come on over
F#m
      Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over
   D         Em      D           Em
Valerie  Valerie   Valerie   Valerie

         D
Did you have to go to jail
put your house out up for sale
                   Em
did you get a good lawyer?
           D
I hope you didn't catch a tan
I hope you find the right man
              Em
who'll fix it for you

         D
Are you shopping anywhere
change the color of your hair
        Em
are you busy?
         D
Did you have to pay that fine
that you were dodging all the time
              Em
are you still dizzy?

      G
Well since I've come home
        F#m
Well my body's been a mess
      G
And I miss your tender hair
        F#m
and the way you like to dress

G
   Won't you come on over
F#m
      Stop making a fool out of me
Oh why don't you come on over
   D         Em      D           Em
Valerie  Valerie   Valerie   Valerie

{No drums}
         D
Well Sometimes I go out by myself
                      Em                                               
and I look across the water

{Drums return}

       D
And I think of all the things, of what you're doing
                         Em
and in my head I paint a picture

      G
Well since I've come home
        F#m
Well my body's been a mess
      G
And I miss your tender hair
        F#m
and the way you like to dress

G
   Won't you come on over
F#m
      Stop making a fool out of me
Oh why don't you come on over

   D         Em      D           Em
Valerie  Valerie   Valerie   Valerie
   D         Em      D           Em
Valerie  Valerie   Valerie   Valerie
                               D
Why Don't You Come On Over Valerie...
