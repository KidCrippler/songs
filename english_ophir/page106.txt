     I got my first real six-string
A
     Bought it at the five-and-dime
D
     Played it 'til my fingers bled
A
     It was the summer of '69
D
    Me and some guys from school
A
    Had a band and we tried real hard
D
    Jimmy quit, Joey got married
A
    I shoulda known we'd never get far

Bm               A
       Oh when I look back now
D                          G
       That summer seem to last forever
Bm              A
       And if I had the choice
D                      G
       Ya - I'd always wanna be there
Bm                     A!              D       A
        Those were the best days of my life

D
       Ain't no use in complainin'
A
       When you got a job to do
D
       Spent my evenings down at the drive in
A
       And that's when I met you

Bm                      A 
       Standing on your mama's porch
D                             G
       You told me that you'd wait forever
Bm                     A
       Oh and when you held my hand
D                         G
       I knew that it was now or never
Bm                    A!              D
       Those were the best days of my life

We were young and restless

We needed to unwind

     I guess nothing can last forever, forever no

D       A        D       A    

D
      And now the times are changing
A
      Look at everything that's come and gone
