     I got my first real six-string

   Bought it at the five-and-dime
D
   Played it 'til my fingers bled
A
  Was the summer of '69

A
  Had a band and we tried real hard

D
     Ain't no use in complainin'
A
   When you got a job to do
D
 I Spent my evenings down at the drive in
A
     And that's when I met you

Bm                  A 
   Standing on your mama's porch
D                        G
  You told me that you'd wait forever
Bm                 A
