Life on mars? â€“ David Bowie
 
E         G#m/Eb                Bm6/D
   It's a god-awful small affair
       C#7                      F#m
To the girl with the mousy hair
        F#m/E                  F#m/Eb
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
        B7                    E
And her daddy has told her to go
        G#m/Eb                     Bm6/D
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
        C#7                           F#m
Now she walks through her sunken dream
       F#m/E                      F#m/Eb
To the seat with the clearest view
          B7                         D
And she's hooked to the silver screen
        D#dim                   Em
But the film is a saddening bore
          F                         C/G
For she's lived it ten times or more
          Caug/G                   Am
She could spit in the eyes of fools
        C7/A#
As they ask her to focus on

A         D                          F#m
Sailors   fighting in the dance hall
        Faug                  E    Em
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
                   Bm    Dm7
It's the freakiest show      

Take a look at the
A         D                        F#m
Lawman    Beating up the wrong guy
        Faug                      E    Em
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
                         Bm    Dm7
He's in the best selling show
                 F#m      /F   /E   /D#
Is there life on Mars?

E     Fo    F#m     Go     G#m      A      Am

E            G#m/Eb                 Bm6/D
    It's on America's tortured brow
            C#7                     F#m
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
        F#m/E                       F#m/Eb
Now the workers have struck for fame
       B7                     E
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
        G#m/Eb                      Bm6/D
See the mice in their million hordes
        C#                 F#m
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
        F#m/E                   F#m/Eb
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
      B7                          D
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
        D#dim                    Em
But the film is a saddening bore
          F                         C/G
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
      Caug/G                 Am
It's about to be writ again
     C7/A#
As I ask you to focus on
