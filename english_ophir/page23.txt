Across the universe â€“ The beatles (-1)

D     Bm      F#m     F#m     A7     A7

D                 Bm               F#m
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
      Em7                              A                A7
They slither while they pass they slip away across the Universe
D                Bm                F#m
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
  Em7            Gm          Gm
Possessing and caressing me

D                      A7sus4
Jai Guru Deva          Om
A7                                 G                         D
Nothing's gonna change my world    Nothing's gonna change my world  X2

D          Bm                F#m                            Em7
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
                         A           A7
They call me on and on across the Universe
D                Bm              F#m
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox
     Em7                               A                  A7
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the Universe

D                      A7sus4
Jai Guru Deva          Om
A7                                 G                         D
Nothing's gonna change my world    Nothing's gonna change my world  X2

D                   Bm                  F#m
Sounds of laughter, shades of earth are ringing through my opened ears
  Em7          Gm         Gm
Inciting and inviting me
D            Bm	              F#m                             Em7
Limitless, undying love which shines around me like a million suns
                         A	     A7
And calls me on and on across the Universe

D                      A7sus4
Jai Guru Deva          Om
A7                                 G                         D
Nothing's gonna change my world    Nothing's gonna change my world  X2

D                          
Jai Guru Deva             [x many times + fade out]
