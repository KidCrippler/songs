All By Myself - Eric Carmen

When I was young
        Bbm       F   Cm
I never needed anyone
           D                 Gm   Bbm  
And makin' love was just for fun
               F   Bbm C
Those days are gone

F
Livin' alone
           Bbm                  F     Cm
I think of all the friends I've known
           D            Gm    Bbm
But when I dial the telephone
         F      D      G Bbm C7
Nobody's home

F           Am
   All by myself
                Cm      D    Gm      Bbm 
Don't wanna be,     all by myself anymore
F           Am
   All by myself
                Cm      D    Gm      Bbm 
Don't wanna be,     all by myself anymore

F
Hard to be sure
            Bbm         F    Cm
Sometimes I feel so insecure
            D              Gm   Bbm
And love so distant and obscure
            F   Bbm C
Remains the cure
