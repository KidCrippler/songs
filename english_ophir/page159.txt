   They told him "Don't you ever come around here"
      Em                               D
Don't wanna see your face,  You better disappear
    C                             D
The fires in their eyes and their words are really clear
   Em               D
So beat it     Just beat it

Em                        D
You better run You better do what you can
      Em                             D
Don't wanna see no blood  Don't be a macho man
        C                  D
You wanna be tough  Better do what you can
   Em               D
So beat it  But you wanna be bad

     Em              D

Em                   D
No one wants to be defeated
Em                         D
Showing how funky    and strong is your fight
Em                D
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Don't wanna be a boy You wanna be a man
    C                        D
You wanna stay alive  Better do what you can
   Em               D
So beat it     Just beat it
Em                                   D
   You have to show them that you're really not scared
       Em                                   D
You're playing with your life This ain't no truth or dare
        C                                          D
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you its fair
