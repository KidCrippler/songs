Another Girl - The Beatles
Lyrics and Music: Paul McCartney,John Lennon

           A    D         A     D          A
For I have got      another girl     another girl

(A)                 G                  A             D
   You're makin' me say that I've got     nobody but you
A                G                    A                  D
   And as from today, well, I've got     somebody that's new
                                              E!
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
           A    D         A     D          A
For I have got      another girl     another girl

(A)                   G                  A                   D
   She's sweeter than all the girls and     I've met quite a few
A            G                 A                  D
   Nobody in all the world can    do what she can do
                                               E!
And so I'm telling you, this time you'd better stop

           A    D         A     D
For I have got      another girl
        C             G                C     G
Another girl who will love me 'til the end
                  C              E             A7      E
Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend

(A)                G                   A               D
   I don't want to say that I've been     unhappy with you
A                G                     A                  D
   but as from today, well, I've seen     somebody that's new
                                              E!
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

           A    D         A     D
For I have got      another girl
        C             G                C     G
Another girl who will love me 'til the end
                  C              E             A7      E
Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend

(A)                G                   A               D
   I don't want to say that I've been     unhappy with you
A                G                     A                  D
   but as from today, well, I've seen     somebody that's new
                                              E!
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
 
           A    D         A     D          A     D          A!
For I have got      another girl     another girl     another girl
