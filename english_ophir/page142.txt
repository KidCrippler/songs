                  Em                  A
Walking round the room singing stormy weather
    Em                 A
at 57 mount Pleasant street
              Em                         A
well it's the same room but everything's different
                  Em                 A
you can fight the sleep but not the dream

Dm          C            Dm        C
   Things ain't cooking      in my kitchen
Dm            C            F    F
   strange affliction wash over me
Dm        C       Dm                C    
   Julius ceasar      and the roman empire 
Dm          C           F        G
   couldn't conquer the blue sky

Well there's a small boat made of china
           Em                 A
it's going nowhere on a mantelpiece
          Em                    A
well do I lie like a loungeroom lizard
        Bm                 A
or do I sing like a bird released
