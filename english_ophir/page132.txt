{piano}
A         C#m
{drums+guitar+bass}
A         C#m

[female]
A                                                  C#m
Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
A                                                 C#m
Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore
[both]
      A                           C#m
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind   
[female]
          A               A!
For me it happens all the time

[both]
        E                                     Abm
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
E                                                  Abm
Said I wouldn't come, but I lost all control and I need you now
      A                    A
And I don't know how I can do without
A!              A     C#m
I just need you now

[male]
 A                                                 C#m
Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
A                                                C#m
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
[both]
      A                           C#m
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
[male]
          A               A!
For me it happens all the time

[both]
        E                                          Abm
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
E                                                  Abm
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
      A                    A
And I don't know how I can do without  
A               C#m       B - E          A          B   
I just need you now
                      C#m       B - E          A          B
                   wo-wow

               A!                           C#m   B
Yes I'd rather hurt than feel nothing    at a-----ll
[female]
        E                                     Abm
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
[male]
      E                                                    Abm
And I said I wouldn't call,   but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
[both]
      A                    A           A               E     Abm
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you no-----w

                E         Abm       E     Abm
I just need you no--------w
[female]
                   E          Abm       
Oh baby I need you no--------w
