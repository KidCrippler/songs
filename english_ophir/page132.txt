{piano}                  {bass}
A         C#m        A         C#m
{drums+guitar}
A         C#m        A        C#m
 
A                                                  C#m
Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
A                                                 C#m
Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore
      A                           C#m
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind   
          A               A!
For me it happens all the time

        E                                     Abm
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
E                                                  Abm
Said I wouldn't come, but I lost all control and I need you now
      A                    A           A               A     C#m
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

 A                                                 C#m
Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
A                                                C#m
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
      A                           C#m
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
          A               A!
For me it happens all the time

        E                                     Abm
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
E                                                 Abm
Said I wouldnt call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
      A                    A
And I don't know how I can do without,    
A               C#m       B E       A       B   
I just need you now
                C#m       B E       A       B   

               A!  {quiet}                                                 C#m   B
Yes I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
        E                                     Abm
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
E                                                 Abm
Said I wouldnt call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
      A                    A
And I don't know how I can do without,    
A               E         Abm
I just need you now
                E         Abm
I just need you now
                E     Abm     
                   E      Abm       
Oh baby I need you now
