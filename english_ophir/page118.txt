A       Bm7       C#m       Bm7
A       Bm7       C#m       Bm7

           A            Bm7
There's a place in your heart
      C#m             Bm7/E
And I know that it is love
          A
And this place could be much
Bm7             C#m     Bm7/E
Brighter than tomorrow
       A          Bm7
And if you really try
            C#m                Bm7/E
You'll find there's no need to cry
        A
In this place you'll feel
Bm7                C#m    Bm7/E
There's no hurt or sorrow

          Bm7         C#m
There are     ways to get there
       D                   C#m
If you care enough for the living
       Bm7
Make a little space
       E
Make a better place

         A
Heal the world
          Bm7
Make it a better place
    D
For you and for me
        A            A    C#m/G#
And the entire human race
          F#m          C#m
There are       people dying
       D                   C#m
If you care enough for the living
       Bm7              D           A
Make a better place for you and for me

Bm7     C#m      Bm7

       A            Bm7
If you want to know why
          C#m              Bm7/E
There's a love that cannot lie
        A              Bm7 
Love is strong it only cares 
           C#m     Bm7/E
for joyful giving
      A            Bm7
If we try we shall see
        C#m             Bm7/E
In this bliss we cannot feel
        A             Bm7
Fear or dread we stop existing
          C#m     Bm7/E
And start living

        Bm7            C#m
Then it     feels that always
D                    C#m
Love's enough for us growing
          Bm7
So make a better world
       E
Make a better world

         A
Heal the world
          Bm7
Make it a better place
    D
For you and for me
        A            A    C#m/G#
And the entire human race
          F#m         C#m
There are      people dying
       D                   C#m
If you care enough for the living
       Bm7              D           A
Make a better place for you and for me

        G
And the dream we were conceived in
              A
Will reveal a joyful face
        G
And the world we once believed in
           A
Will shine again in grace
     F#m            C#m
Then why do we keep strangling life
           D                  C#m
Wound this earth crucify this soul
            Bm7
Though it's plain to see

This world is heavenly
D! D!    D!
Be God's glow

         A      Bm7
We could fly so high
        C#m           Bm7/E
Let our spirits never die
      A            Bm7
In my heart I feel you 
            C#m      Bm7/E
are all my brothers
         A             Bm7
Create a world with no fear
         C#m             Bm7/E
Together we'll cry happy tears
        A                  Bm7
See the nations turn their swords
        C#m        Bm7/E
Into plowshares

        Bm7            C#m
Then it     feels that always
D                    C#m
Love's enough for us growing

So make a better world
