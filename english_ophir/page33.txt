F       Dm       Am
     Oh no,    I see
   Eb            Gm              F
a spider web has tangled up with me
  Dm      Am    
I lost my head 
    Eb	                Gm                F
and thought of all the stupid things I've said

F       Dm        Am
     Oh no what's this 
   Eb                Gm
a spider web and I'm caught in the middle
F        Dm        Am
    So I turned to run 
    Eb	                Gm                F
and thought of all the stupid things I've done

    G                           Dm
And I never meant to cause you trouble
    G                        Dm
And I never meant to do you wrong
    G                             Dm
But oh well if I ever caused you trouble
G                             Dm
Oh no I never meant to do you harm

F      Dm      Am      F     Dm      Am

F       Dm        Am
     Oh no,     I see 
   Eb                Gm
a spider web and its me in the middle
F         Dm       Am
    So I twist and turn 
    Eb           Gm               F
and here am I in my little bubble 

       G                           Dm
Sining I never meant to cause you trouble
    G                        Dm
And I never meant to do you wrong
    G                             Dm
But oh well if I ever caused you trouble
G                             Dm
Oh no I never meant to do you harm

F     Dm     Am	     F     Dm     Am
