 D    A  Bm   Bm/A
Wise men say
      G    D/F#  A/E   A
Only fools rush  in
    G  A    Bm   Em         D/A   A    D
But I can't help falling in love with you
  D   A   Bm    Bm/A
Shall I  stay?
          G  D/F#  A/E   A  
Would it be   a    sin
   G  A    Bm   Em         D/A   A    D
If I can't help falling in love with you?

F#m           C#7
Like a river flows
F#m           C#7
Surely to the sea
F#m            C#7
Darling, so it goes
F#m         B              Em   A
Some things   are meant to be

 D   A  Bm   Bm/A
Take my hand
          G   D/F#   A/E   A
Take my whole life,  too
    G  A    Bm   Em         D/A   A    D
For I can't help falling in love with you

F#m           C#7
Like a river flows
F#m           C#7
Surely to the sea
F#m            C#7
Darling, so it goes
F#m         B              Em   A
Some things   are meant to be

 D   A  Bm   Bm/A
Take my hand
          G   D/F#   A/E   A
Take my whole life,  too
    G  A    Bm   Em         D/A   A    D
For I can't help falling in love with you
