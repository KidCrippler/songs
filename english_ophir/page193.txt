I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
  E                             B
I knew he musta been about seventeen
    A                B
The beat was going strong
 E                  A    A
Playin' my favorite song
            A 
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
                 A   
Till he was with me, yeah me
            A
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long

He smiled so I got up an' asked for his name
E                                               B
That don't matter, he said, 'Cause it's all the same
A                   B
Said can I take you home
      E          A     A
where we can be alone
