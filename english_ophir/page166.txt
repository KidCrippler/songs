Just the two of us - Bill Withers

C7+     B7     Em    Dm G
C7+     B7     Em    Em

C7+        B7              Em    
I see the crystal rain drops fall,
               Dm  G           C
and the beauty of it all 
             B7                Em      
Is when the sun comes shining through
C7+           B7               Em
To make those rainbows in my mind, 
       Dm            G      C
When I think of you sometime, 
                       B7                   Em   
And I want to spend some time with you. 

         C         B7         Em            Dm     G7
Just the two of us,    we can make it if we try, 
         C         B7            Em      
Just the two of us,    (just the two of us)
         C         B7         Em             Dm    G7
Just the two of us,  building castles in the sky,
         C         B7         Em  
Just the two of us,   you and I.

C             B7              Em    
We look for love, no time for tears,
       Dm      G          C
wasted water's all that is, 
             B7            Em  
And it don't make no flowers grow.
C                 B7               Em
Good things might come to those who wait, 
             Dm       G        C
But not for those who wait too late
             B7            Em 
We've got to go for all we know. 


         C         B7         Em            Dm     G7
Just the two of us,    we can make it if we try, 
         C         B7            Em      
Just the two of us,    (just the two of us)
         C         B7         Em             Dm    G7
Just the two of us,  building castles in the sky,
         C         B7         Em  
Just the two of us,   you and I.

I hear the crystal raindrops fall on the window down the hall
            B7             Em  
And it becomes the morning dew.
C           B7               Em
And Darling, when the morning comes 
      Dm      G       C
And I see the morning sun,
          B7              Em 
I want to be the one with you.
