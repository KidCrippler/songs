All My Loving - The Beatles (+2)
Lyrics and Music: Lennon–McCartney

           Em            A7          D           Bm
Close your eyes and I´ll kiss you, tomorrow I´ll miss you
  G           Em         C     A7
Remember I´ll always be true
         Em         A7             D         Bm
And then while I´m away I´ll write home everyday
         G           A         D
And I´ll send all my loving to you

        Em            A7           D         Bm
I´ll pretend that I´m kissing, the lips I am missing
    G            Em               C     A7
And hope that my dreams will come true
         Em         A7             D         Bm
And then while I´m away I´ll write home everyday
         G           A         D
And I´ll send all my loving to you

       Bm     Bbaug          D
All my loving I will send to you
       Bm      Bbaug           D
All my loving, darling I´ll be true
