   Everyday is so wonderful.
         Bm                Bb
And suddenly, it's hard to breath.
D                    D/C 
   Now and then i get insecure
             Bm              Bb
From all the pain.   I'm so ashamed.

G                    Em
   I am beautiful no matter what they say,
D          D/C       Bm
Words can't bring me down.
G                    Em 
   I am beautiful in every single way,
    D           C        Bm
yes Words can't bring me down.
Em                               D
    So don't you bring me down today.

D                              D/C
   To all your friends you're delirious
      Bm                Bb
So consumed in all your doom.
D                         D/C
   Trying hard to fill the emptiness
           Bm                      Bb
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
That's the way it is.

G                       Em

D           D/C       Bm

                 D/C
No matter what we do
                  Bm
No matter what we say
                               Bb
We'll sing the song inside the tune
                            D
Full of beautiful mistakes.
                     D/C
And everywhere we go
                          Bm 
The sun will always shine
                      Bb
And tomorrow we might wake up 
on the other side.

G                      Em
