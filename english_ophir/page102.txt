You get a shiver in the dark
     C              Bb       A           A
it's raining in the park but meantime
Dm                         C           Bb          A      A
    south of the river you stop and you hold everything
F                                  C               C
    a band is blowing Dixie double four time
Bb                                            Dm      Dm    
    you feel alright when you hear that music ring

Bb Bb Bb Bb C

             Dm
Well Now you step inside 
        C         Bb       A        A
but you don't see too many faces
 Dm                       C                Bb      A      A
     coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
F                                        C        C
    too much competition too many other places
Bb                                   Dm        Dm
      But the horns are blowing that sound
Bb Bb Bb Bb C
                way on downsouth

    drunk and dressed in their best 
C                Bb              A      A
brown baggies and their platform soles
F                                     C
