We all came out to Montreux
       G5     F    G5
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
G5                       G5
  To make records with a mobile
G5    F           G5
        We didn't have much time
 
G5                     G5
   Frank Zappa and the Mothers
     G5           F     G5
Were at the best place around
G5                         G5
   But some stupid with a flare gun
G5               F       G5
Burned the place to the ground
 
 C5          Ab         
Smoke on the water, 
Gm
   and fire in the sky
 C5          Ab
Smoke on the water

G5                     G5
  They burned down the gamblinG5house
   G5           F     G5
It died with an awful sound
G5                    G5
   A funky Claude was runninG5in and out
G5    F         G5
        Pulling kids outa the ground
G5                 G5
   When it all was over
   G5           F       G5
We had to find another place
G5                    G5
   But Swiss time was runninG5out
   G5                   F        G5
It seemed that we would lose the race
 
 C5          Ab         
Smoke on the water, 
Gm
   and fire in the sky
 C5          Ab
Smoke on the water

   We ended up at the Grand Hotel
G5       F     G5
  It was empty cold and bare

But with the 
G5                   G5
Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
G5   F            G
       Making our music there
       G5                G5
With a few red lights, a few old beds
G5             F        G5
    We made a place to sweat
G5                   G5
   No matter what we get out of this
G5         F               G5
   I know,    I know we'll never forget
 
 C5          Ab         
Smoke on the water, 
Gm
   and fire in the sky
 C5          Ab
Smoke on the water
