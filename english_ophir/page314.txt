I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend if it makes you feel alright
     F7                               C
I'll get you anything my friend if it makes you feel alright
      G7              F7!                 F7                 C
Cause I don't care too    much for money, money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I've got to give if you say you love me too
  F7                                    C
I may not have a lot to give but what I got I'll give to you
      G7              F7!                 F7                 C
Cause I don't care too    much for money, money can't buy me love

             Em   Am      C
Can't buy me lo---ve      everybody tells me so
             Em   Am    Dm          G
Can't buy me lo---ve,   no, no, no, no.....

Say you don't need no diamond rings and I'll be satisfied
F7                                            C
Tell me that you want the kind of things that money just can't buy
G7              F7!                 F7                 C
I don't care too    much for money, money can't buy me love
