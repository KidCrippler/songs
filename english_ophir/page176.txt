You've Got A Friend - James Taylor (-3)
Lyrics and Music: Carole King

C    C    F    F    C    C    Bm7  -  E7  -
 
            Am        E7              Am     E7      Am
When you're down and troubled and you need a helping hand
    Dm7         G7                C      Csus4       C
and nothing, oh nothing is going right
 Bm7                 E7              Am    E7       Am
Close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there
    Dm7        Em7               G7sus4       G7
to brighten up even your darkest night
 
          C                           F
You just call out my name,  and you know wherever I am
           C        C4                G7sus4     G7
I'll come running         to see you again
C                          Cmaj7    F                     Am      C7/G
Winter, spring, summer, or fall,    all you got to do is call
        Fmaj7      F/G        [G7sus4]
and I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah
               C    C    F    F    C    C    Bm7      -   E7    -
You've got a friend

       Am     E7                   Am       E7            Am
If the sky   above you should turn dark and full of clouds
         Dm7       G7                   C       Csus4       C
and that old north wind should begin to blow
Bm7                    E7           Am      E7       Am
      keep your head together   and call my name out loud
Dm7                  Em7                G7sus4       G7
       Soon I'll be knocking upon your door

          C                           F
You just call out my name,  and you know wherever I am
           C        C4                G7sus4     G7
I'll come running         to see you again
C                          Cmaj7    F                     Am      C7/G
Winter, spring, summer, or fall,    all you got to do is call
        Fmaj7      F/G        [G7sus4]
and I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah

    Bb                          F
Hey ain't it good to know that you've got a friend when
 C               Cmaj7
people can be so cold
         F             Bb
They'll hurt you and desert you
        Am                    D
They'll take your soul if you let them
             G7sus4                G7
Oh yeah, but don't you let them
 
          C                           F
You just call out my name,  and you know wherever I am

I'll come running         to see you again
C                          Cmaj7    F                     Am      C7/G
Winter, spring, summer, or fall,    all you got to do is call
        Fmaj7           F/G        [G7sus4]
and I'll be there,   yes I will
