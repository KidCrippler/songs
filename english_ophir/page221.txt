Once,     there was this kid who
Bb          F
got into an accident 
    C                F
and couldn't come to school
    Bb                  C    F
but when     he finally came back
C    F     Bb
his  hair      
                 F          C            C   C
had turned from black into bright white
   C#               F

Once,      there was this girl who
Bb              F
wouldn't go and change 
         C            F
with the girls in the change room
    Bb                   C     F
but when    they finally made  her
C     F    Bb
they  saw
               F        C     C    C
birthmarks all over her body
    C#                F
She couldn't quite explain it
       C#          Bbsus4+  Bbsus4+  Bb    Bb
they'd always just been              there

    Both girl and boy were glad
Gm                       F          C
    that one kid  had it worse than that

      Dm    C                F
Cause then    there was this boy whose
Bb               F
parents made him come
         C                F
directly home right after school
    Bb                    C      F
And when     they went to their  church
C       F     Bb
they    shook
                F        C            C    C
and lurched all over the church floor
   C#                F
He couldn't quite explain it
       C#          Bbsus4+  Bbsus4+  Bb    Bb
they'd always just gone              there
