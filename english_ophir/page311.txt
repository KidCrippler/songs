Lyrics and Music: Paul McCartney,John Lennon

G           Bm
  To lead a better life,
Bb                     Am7  D7
  I need my love to be here

G     Am   Bm          C          G     Am
Here,      making each day of the year
Bm          C           F#m7        B7
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
F#m7    B7   Em              Am         Am7   D7
Nobody can deny that there's something there

G     Am   Bm         C                 G     Am
There,     running my hands through her hair
Bm         C            F#m7        B7
Both of us thinking how good it can be
F#m7       B7            Em          Am         Am7   D7
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

  /F       Bb         Gm
I want her everywhere
       Cm              D7            Gm         Gm
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
Cm              D7
But to love her is to need her

G         Am   Bm           C          G     Am
everywhere     knowing that love is to share
Bm         C            F#m7       B7
Each one believing that love never dies
F#m7         B7        Em         Am     Am7    D7
Watching her eyes, and hoping I'm always there

  /F       Bb         Gm
I want her everywhere
       Cm              D7            Gm         Gm
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
Cm              D7
But to love her is to need her

G         Am   Bm           C          G     Am
everywhere     knowing that love is to share
Bm         C            F#m7        B7
Each one believing that love never dies
F#m7         B7        Em         Am     Am7   D7
Watching her eyes, and hoping I'm always there

          G     Am      Bm   C
I will be there,    and everywhere
G     Am         Bm   C     G
Here, there, and everywhere
