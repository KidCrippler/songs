      F
I was told a million times
           Bb             F
Of all the troubles in my way
        F
How to grow a little wiser
       Bb           F
Little better every day
         C
But if I crossed a million rivers
      C#
And I rode a million miles
         Ab
Then I'd still be where I started
          C
Bread and butter for a smile
       F
Well I sold a million mirrors
     Bb             F
In a shopping alley way
      F
But I never saw my face
       Bb         F
In any window any day
          C
Well they say your folks are telling you
   C#
To be a superstar
      Ab
But I tell you just be satisfied
   A7
To stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive

Honey you'll survive

          F
Well I've loved a million women
     Bb         F
In a belladonic haze
      F
And I ate a million dinners
           Bb           F
Brought to me on silver trays
        C
Give me everything I need
           C#
To feed my body and my soul
         Ab
And I'll grow a little bigger
      C
Maybe that can be my goal
      F
I was told a million times
           Bb           F
Of all the people in my way
      F
How I had to keep on trying
        Bb           F
And get better every day
          C
But if I crossed a million rivers
      C#
And I rode a million miles
         Ab
Then I'd still be where I started
A7
Still be where I started
