      F                                Bb            F
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
        F                          Bb           F
How to grow a little wiser, little better every day
          C
But if I crossed a million rivers
      C#
And I rode a million miles
         Ab
Then I'd still be where I started
          C
Bread and butter for a smile
       F                           Bb             F
Well I sold a million mirrors in a shopping alley way
      F                        Bb         F
But I never saw my face in any window any day
          C
Well they say your folks are telling you
   C#
To be a superstar
      Ab
But I tell you just be satisfied
   A7
To stay right where you are

D              D       D              A
Keep yourself alive    keep yourself alive
      D         F#     Bm           G
It'll take you all your time and the money
A               D
Honey you'll survive

          F                          Bb         F
Well I've loved a million women in a belladonic haze
      F                                Bb            F
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
        C
Give me everything I need
           C#
To feed my body and my soul
         Ab
And I'll grow a little bigger
      C
Maybe that can be my goal
      F                               Bb           F
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
      F                             Bb           F
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
          C
But if I crossed a million rivers
      C#
And I rode a million miles
         Ab
Then I'd still be where I started
A7
Still be where I started

D              D       D              A
Keep yourself alive    keep yourself alive
      D        F#       Bm           G
It'll take you all your time and the money
A               D
Honey you'll survive
