  Em                    G            D                   C 
I come from down in the valley Where mister, when you're young
     Em              G       C               G 
They bring you up to do      like your daddy done
       C                               G           D/F#     Em 
Me and Mary we met in high school When she was just seven - teen
     Am                               G                     C!
We'd drive out of this valley down to where the fields were green

        Em          C          D                   G 
We'd go down to the river  And into the river we'd dive
   Em          C          D      C 
Oh down to the river we’d ride

     Em          G               D                      C 
Then I got Mary pregnant     And man, that was all she wrote
    Em          G                      C                  G 
And for my 19th birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
   C                                   G           D/F#    Em 
We went down to the courthouse And the judge put it all to rest
   Am 
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
   G                   C 
No flowers, no wedding dress

                   Em          C           D                   G 
That night we went down to the river   And into the river we'd dive
   Em          C          D      C 
Oh down to the river we’d ride

  Em                        G               D              C 
I got a job working con - struction for the Johnstown Company
    Em                      G              C                 G 
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
    C 
Now all them things that seemed so important
            G            D/F#            Em 
Well mister they vanished right into the air
           Am                             G                   C 
Now I just act like I don't remember Mary acts like she don't care

      Em                        G
But I remember us riding in my brother's car 
         D                       C
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir 
   Em                      G 
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
             C                       G 
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
          C 
Now those memories come back to haunt me
     G       D/F#    Em 
They haunt me like a curse
     Am                                   G               C 
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true Or is it something worse

              Em          C              D                 G 
That sends me down to the river Though I know the river is dry
              Em          C       D       C 
That sends me down to the river tonight
Em          C        D        G 
Down to the river my baby and I
   Em          C        D   C 
Oh down to the river we ri--de  
 
Em          C            D            G 
Ooh..
Em          C            D            C 
Ooh..

Em          C            D            G 
Em          C            D            C
