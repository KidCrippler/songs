Vincent ( Starry, Starry Night) - Don McLean

                G      Gsus4   G
Starry, starry  night
                   Am            Aadd9  Am
paint your palette blue and grey
              C
Look out on a summer's day
     D                                 G
with eyes that know the darkness in my soul
               G     Gsus4  G
Shadows on the hills
                         Am         Aadd9  Am
Sketch the trees and the daffodills
                     C
Catch the breeze and winter chills
   D                         G      C   G
in colors on the snowy linen land

            Am      D
Now I understand
                  G     G/F#       Em
what you tried to Say   to me
                          Am       D
how you suffered for your sanity
                           Em!G
How you tried to set them free
                                A             Am
they would not listen, they did not know how
   D                    G    C   
Perhaps they'll listen  now

                G     Gsus4  G
Starry, starry  night
                      Am              Aadd9  Am
flaming flowers that Brightly blaze
                   C
swirling clouds in violet haze
   D                               G
Reflecting Vincent’s eyes of China Blue
                G     Gsus4  G
Colors changing hue
                  Am              Aadd9 Am
Morning fields of amber grain
                C
Weathered faces lined with pain
    D                                  G
Are soothed beneath the artists loving hand

            Am
Now I understand
                  D     G G/F#      Em
what you tried to Say   to me
                          Am       D
how you suffered for your sanity
                          Em!
How you tried to set them free
                                A            Am
they would not listen, they did not know how
   D                    G    
Perhaps they'll listen  now

                   Am        D
For they could not love you
                         G    G/F#   Em
but still your love was true
            Am
And when no hope was left in sight
        Cm
On that starry, starry night
    G                 Dm               E7
you took your life as lovers sometimes do
      Am
But I could have told you, Vincent
C                                     D            G    C   G
this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you

                G       Gsus4  G
Starry, starry  night
                  Am             Aadd9    Am
portraits hung in Empty halls
                  C
fearless heads on nameless walls
     D                                      G
with eyes that watch the world and can’t forget
                               G     Gsus4  G
Like the strangers that you’ve met
                  Am              Aadd9 Am
The ragged men in ragged clothes
                     C
The silver thorn of bloody rose
     D                                G
lie Crushed and broken on the virgin snow

                  Am        D
And now I think I know
                  G    G/F#       Em
What you tried to Say to me
                          Am       D
How you suffered for your sanity
                           Em!
How you tried to set them free
                                             A      Am 
They would not listen, they’re not listening still
   D              G     
Perhaps the never will
