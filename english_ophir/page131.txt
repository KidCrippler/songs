I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues - Elton John 

C   Em   F   F
C   Em   F   F

G        
   Don't wish it away
      Em              F       C  Dm  C  Dm  C  Dm
Don't look at it like it's forever
   C            G
Between you and me
                 Bm       F                   C  Dm  C  Dm  C  Dm
I could honestly say that things can only get better
    C         G    B7                    Em    Dm
And while I'm away dust out the demons inside 
                C                      G
And it won't be long before you and me run
                       Am    F      G     G
To the place in our hearts where we hide

      C                     G           F
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
           C              G               F
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
C             G   
Laughing like children
G           Am
Living like lovers
C            F                  D/F#
Rolling like thunder, under the covers
      F                     G           C    G   F
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

G
    Just stare into space
Em         F            C  Dm  C  Dm  C  Dm
Picture my face in your hands
C             G
Live for each second  
            Bm	    F	                  C  Dm  C  Dm  C  Dm
Without hesitation, never forget I'm your man
C          G     B7                     Em    Dm
Wait on me girl, cry in the night if it helps
              C                  G
But more than ever I simply love you
            Am   F      G      G
More than I love life itself

      C                     G           F
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
           C              G               F
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
C             G   
Laughing like children
G           Am
Living like lovers
C            F                  D/F#
Rolling like thunder, under the covers
      F                     G           C    G   F
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
