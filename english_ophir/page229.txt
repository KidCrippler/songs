Live Forever - Oasis

{drums - \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \ }

G
Maybe
        D
I don't really want to know
         Am
How your garden grows
   C               D
As I just want to fly
G
Lately
             D
did you ever feel the pain
       Am
In the morning rain
      C                D
As it soaks you to the bone

Em                        D
    Maybe I just want to fly
                            Am
Wanna live, I don't want to die
                      C
Maybe I just want to breathe
      D              Em
Maybe I just don't believe
                         D
Maybe you're the same as me
                            Am
We see things they'll never see
You and I
                    F9       F9
we're gonna live forever

        G
I said maybe
        D
I don't really wanna know
         Am
How your garden grows
      C               D
Cause I just want to fly

Lately
        D

In the morning rain
      C                D

Em                     D
    Maybe I will never be
                            Am
All the things that I wanna be
                        C
Now is not the time to cry
          D                Em
Now's the time to find out why
                           D
I think you're the same as me
                            Am
We see things they'll never see

You and I 
                  F9        F9
are gonna live forever
