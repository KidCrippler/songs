Out on the wiley, windy moors
     E                 C#
We'd roll and fall in green
A                 F                E
You had a temper,    like my jealousy
              C#
Too hot, too greedy
A                        F
  How could you leave me?   When I needed to
E              C#                Ab
  possess you?    I hated you, I loved you too

Ebm       F#           Fsus4
     Bad dreams in the night
Ebm            F#

Fsus4
going to lose the fight

Ooh it gets dark,       it gets lonely
E               C#
   On the other side from you
A                F
