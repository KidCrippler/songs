Here Comes Your Man - Pixies
Lyrics and Music: Black Francis

G       A       D       D
G       A       D       D
G       A       D       D
G       A       D       D

D                   A
  Outside there's a box car waiting
Em            G
  Outside the family stew
D            A
  Out by the fire breathing
Em           G                     D
  Outside we wait 'til face turns blue
            A
 I know the nervous walking
Em           G
  I know the dirty beard hangs
D            A
  Out by the box car waiting
Em                G
  Take me away to nowhere plains

Bm                   G
  There is a wait so long (so long)
    A                          D
(So long) You'll never wait so long

G    A               D     D
     Here comes your man
G    A               D     D
     Here comes your man
G    A               D
     Here comes your man

{Guitar solo}
(D)    A    Em    G

D                  A
  Big shake on the box car moving
Em                 G                   D
  Big shake to the land that's falling down
                    A
  Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
  Em                       G
A big, big stone fall and break my crown

Bm                   G
  There is a wait so long (so long)
    A                          D
(So long) You'll never wait so long

G    A               D     D
     Here comes your man
G    A               D     D
     Here comes your man
G    A               D     D
     Here comes your man

     Here comes your man
