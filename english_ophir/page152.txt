I thought love was only true in fairy tales
G               D                G    G
And for someone else but not for me
C                   G
    Love was out to get me
C                     G
    That's the way it seemed
C                  G              D       D

I thought love was more or less a given thing
G                D                G      G
Seems the more I gave, the less I got
C                  G
What's the use in tryin'?
C                   G
     All you get is pain.
C                  G               D
