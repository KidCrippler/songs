Ebm7    Ab7    C#9     F#maj7
        Ooh,   He ey,  oh
Cm7b5                Bmaj7                 Bb  
What we're living in,      let me tell ya

           Ebm7           Ab7       
And it's a wonder man can eat at all
     C#9                 F#maj7
When things are big that should be small
Cm7b5             Bmaj7
Who can tell what magic spells 
Bb            Ebm7
Will be doing for us?
        Ebm7          Ab7          C#9 
And I'm giving all my love to this world
     F#maj7
Only to be told
Cm7b5        Bmaj7
I can't see, I can't breathe, 
Bb             Ebm7
no more will we be
    Ab7                           C#9           
And nothing's going to change the way we live
     F#maj7                 Cm7b5       
Cos' we can always take but never give
    Bmaj7                       Bb  
And now that things're changing for the worse, see. 
Ebm7 
    Woah,       
Ab7               C#9       
     It's a crazy world we're living in
F#maj7                 Cm7b5     
       And I just can't see that 
        Bmaj7          Bb            Bb7     Dm7b5
Half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these

Bmaj7     Ddim7     Ebm7         Ab7
Futures   made of   virtual    insanity now
Bmaj7     Ddim7        Ebm7             Ab7
Always    seem to   be governed by this love we have for
Bmaj7     Ddim7     Ebm7           Ab7
Useless   twisting  of the new technology
    Bmaj7           Ddim7         Ebm7           Ab7
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground

        Ebm7            Ab7     
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
C#9                F#maj7
Hard to know where to begin
   Cm7b5            Bmaj7
If I could slip the sickly ties 
     Bb        Dm7b5   Ebm7
That earthly   man has made
    Ab7       C#9      F#maj7           Cm7b5   
And now every mother   can choose the color
Bmaj7             Bb            Dm7b5    Ebm7
     Of her child,   that's not nature's way
      Ab7                        C#9            
Well that's what they said yesterday
        F#maj7                 Cm7b5    
There's nothing left to do but pray
  Bmaj7                      Bb         Dm7b5    Ebm7    F#maj7
I think it's time I found  a new    religion,    wo    ah,
     Ab7           C#9          F#maj7
it's so insane to synthesize another strain
        Cm7b5              Bmaj7           Bb        Dm7
There's something in these futures that we have  to be told

Bmaj7             Ddim7     Ebm7                     Ab7

Bmaj7                       Ddim7    Ebm7                      Ab7

Bmaj7                  Ddim7       Ebm7          Ab7
