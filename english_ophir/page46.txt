D
Left a good job in the city
D
workin for the man every night and day
D 
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
D
worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

A
Big wheel a-keep on turnin'
  Bm
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
D              D           D                    D
Roll - in',    rollin',    rollin' on the river

D
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
D
pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans
D
But I never saw the good side of the city
D
till I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

if you come down to the river
D
bet you're gonna find some people who live

you don't have to worry, cause you have no money

people on the river are happy to give
