Lovely Day - Bill Withers

E         C#m7        Amaj7         Cmaj7  Bm7   
E         C#m7        Amaj7         Cmaj7  Bm7   

E                          C#m7               
      When I wake up in the morning love 
Amaj7                         Amaj7    Cmaj7 Bm7
      And the sun it hurts my eyes 
E                          C#m7
      And something without warning love 
Amaj7                   Cmaj     
      Weighs heavy on my mind 
          
C/D                  D/E 
Then I look at you 
                  Am7               Bm7 
And the world's  alright with me 
C/D                  D/E 
Just one look at you 
               Am7         Bm7 
And I know its gonna be 
          
         E

E                         C#m7
    When the day that lies ahead of me 
Amaj7                       Amaj7     Cmaj7  Bm7
        Seems impossible to face 
E                       C#m7
