   Oh – thinkin' about all our younger years 
          Dm           Am
There was only you and me 
        Bb                 G4    G
We were young and wild and free 
C      Am                    G
   Now nothing can take you away from me 
           Dm               Am
We've been down that road before 
           Bb               F  
But that's over now 
            G4              G 
You keep me comin' back for more 

F           G          Am
Baby you're all that I want 
            C                F
When you're lying here in my arms 
    F          G         Am             G      G
I'm findin' it hard to believe We're in heaven
    F       G          Am
And love is all that I need 
      C                      F
And I found it there in your heart 
   F         G       Am               G    G
It isn't too hard to see  We're in heaven

   Oh – once in your life you find someone 
         Dm               Am
Who will turn your world around 
          Bb                     G4    G
Bring you up when you're feelin' down 
C     Am                            G
   Ya nothin' could change what you mean to me 
           Dm                Am
Oh there's lots that I could say 
         Bb                   F  
But just hold me now 
          G4                  G 
Cause our love will light the way 

    F           G          Am
And baby you're all that I want 
            C                F
When you're lying here in my arms

And love is all that I need

Dm                    C      F
     I've bin waitin' for so long 
              G      Am
For something    to arrive 
                  G        G–C
For love to come along 
Dm                     C       F
    Now our dreams are comin' true 
                               C
Through the good times and the bad 
              G
Ya – I'll be standin' there by you
