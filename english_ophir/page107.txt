   Today is gonna be the day 
             Dsus                   A7sus4            
That they're gonna throw it back to you 
Em7           G
   By now you should've somehow 
   Dsus                 A7sus4
Realized what you gotta do 
Em7                  G
I don't believe that anybody 
Dsus            A7sus4         
Feels the way I do
          C      Dsus   A7sus4     A7sus4
About you now 

Em7             G                                {Drums+Bass}
   Backbeat the word was on the street  
         Dsus                  A7sus4
That the fire in your heart is out 
Em7                G
   I'm sure you've heard it all before 
        Dsus               A7sus4
But you never really had a doubt 
Em7                  G
I don't believe that anybody
Dsus            A7sus4
Feels the way I do 
          Em7     G      Dsus     A7sus4
About you now 

    C                D                      Em     Em
And all the roads we have to walk along are winding 
    C                   D                 Em       Em
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding 
C              D           
There are many things that I would 
G       D/F#   Em
Like to say to you 
      D          A7sus4     A7sus4      A7sus4      A7sus4
but I don't know how 

        C     Em   G
Because maybe  
                                   C     Em   G
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
    Em    C     Em    G
And after all 
               C     Em    G     Em!
You're my wonderwall
