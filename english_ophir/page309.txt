   There's nothing you can do that can't be done
G                  D                  Em    D
   Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Am                 G                     D
   Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
     D       D7      D6      D
It's easy
 
G                          D                  Em    D

G                 D                  Em     D
   No one you can save that can't be saved
Am                 G              D
   Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
