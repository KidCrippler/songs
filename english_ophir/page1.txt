G       Dsus4   Fadd9   G    
Here I stand    head in hand 
C                   Fadd9   C
Turn my face to the wall
G        Dsus4  Fadd9    G  
If she's gone I can't go on 
C                Fadd9 C   D
Feeling two foot sma - a - all

G    Dsus4 Fadd9   G     
Everywhere people stare 
C                  Fadd9    C
Each and     every day

I can see them laugh at me
C               Fadd9 C    D D/C D/B D/A
And I hear them say - ay - ay

Hey, you've got to hide your love away

G       Dsus4 Fadd9 G 
How can I     even try 
C           Fadd9  C
I can never win
G       Dsus4 Fadd9  G 
Hearing them, seeing them 
C                Fadd9 C  D
In the state I'm i  -  i  in

G         Dsus4 Fadd9  G 
How could she   say to me 
C                Fadd9  C
Love will find a way
G       Dsus4  Fadd9    G 
Gather 'round, all you clowns
