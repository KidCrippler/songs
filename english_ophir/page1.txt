Lyrics and Music: Lennon–McCartney

G     G 

G      Dsus4    F       G    
Here I stand    head in hand 
C                   F       C
Turn my face to the wall
G       Dsus4   F        G  
If she's gone I can't go on 
C                F     C   D
Feeling two foot sma - a - all

G   Dsus4  F       G     
Everywhere people stare 
C                  F        C
Each and     every day
G    Dsus4     F        G   
I can see them laugh at me
C               F     C    D D/C D/B D/A
And I hear them say - ay - ay

G                  C              Dsus4   D Dsus2  D
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
G                  C              Dsus4   D Dsus2  D
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

G    Dsus4    F     G 
How can I     even try 
C           F      C
I can never win
G     Dsus4   F      G 
Hearing them, seeing them 
C                F    C   D
In the state I'm i---------n

G       Dsus4   F      G 
How could she   say to me 
C                F      C
Love will find a way
G     Dsus4    F        G 
Gather 'round, all you clowns
C               F     C    D D/C D/B D/A
Let me hear you say - ay - ay

G                  C              Dsus4   D Dsus2  D
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
G                  C              Dsus4   D Dsus2  D
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

G   Dsus4  F       G    C   C   F       C 
G   Dsus4  F       G    C   C   F       C    G
