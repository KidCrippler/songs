[bass]
D    C      G      D

D                                           C    
She's got a smile that it seems to me,    Reminds me of childhood memories
      G                                           D    
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
D                                          C    
Now and then when I see her face,      She takes me away to that special place
          G                                           D    
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry

A   G                   D                   A       G                    D
Ohhhh    Sweet child o' mine                OhhhhOhOhOh    Sweet love of mine

[Solo guitar] 
D    C    G     D    

D                                     C    
She's got eyes of the bluest skies as if they thought of rain
    G                                D    
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
    D                                          C    
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child I'd hide
     G                                   D    
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

A   G                   D                  A       G                    D
Ohhhh    Sweet child o' mine               OhhhhOhOhOh    Sweet love of mine
A   G                   D                  A       G                    D       D
Ohhhh    Sweet child o' mine               OhhhhOhOhOh    Sweet love of mine
