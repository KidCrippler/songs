G                                   F   C      C
  I can't light,  no more of your   darkness
F                                            G       G
  All my pictures, seem to fade to black and white
G                                            F    C     C
  I'm growing tired, and time stands still before me
F                                    G       G
  Frozen here,   on the ladder of my life 
G                                 F  C      C
  Too late,   to save myself from falling 
F                                           G       G
  I took a chance,  and changed your way of life
G                                     F    C      C
  But you misread,  my meaning when I met  you 
F                               C              G       G7
  Closed the door, and left me blind    by the light   Ohhh

C                       Cadd4
   Don't let the sun go down on me (don't let the sun)
Am                                       D
   Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
C                                    F    G            C      C7
   I'd just allow a fragment of your life    to wander free   yea 
    F                                  Dm        G         C
But losing everything      is like the sun going down on   me

G                               F           C       C
  I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
F                                    G       G
  But see me once, and see the way I feel
G                                    C                      C
  Don't discard me, just because you think I mean you harm 
F                                     C                 G      G7
  But these cuts I have, oh they need love to help them heal
