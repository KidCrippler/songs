     I remember when,     I remember
                          Eb
I remember when I lost my mind
                                           Ab
There was something so pleasant about that phase
 
Even your emotions had an echo
           Gsus4        G
In so much space

     And when you're out there, without care,
                   Eb
Yeah, I was out of touch
                                    Ab
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
                Gsus4         G
I just knew too much

                  Cm
Does that make me crazy
                  Eb
Does that make me crazy
                  Ab
Does that make me crazy
     Gsus4      G
Possibly

C
    And I hope that you are having 
                 Ab
the time of your life
          Eb                    Gsus4     G
But think twice, that's my only advice

Cm
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, 
    Eb
who do you think you are
                        Ab
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
                           Gsus4      G
You really think you're in control

                      Cm
Well, I think you're crazy
                Eb
I think you're crazy
                Ab
I think you're crazy
          Gsus4      G
Just like me

C
    My heroes had the heart 
                             Ab
to lose their lives out on a limb
             Eb
And all I remember is thinking
                  Gsus4     G
I want to be like them

Cm
     Ever since I was little
                                       Eb
ever since I was little it looked like fun
                             Ab
And it's no coincidence I've come
                       Gsus4       G
And I can die when I'm done
 
          Cm
Maybe I'm crazy
              Eb
Maybe you're crazy
             Ab
Maybe we're crazy
     Gsus4      G
Probably
