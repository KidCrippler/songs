It's late at night
        Am7
And I'm feeling down
         G6
There're couples standing on the street 
        Dsus2                   Asus2
sharing summer kisses and silly sounds

(Asus2)    Am7      G6     Dsus2

{Bass}
     Asus2
So I step inside
       Am7
Pour a glass of wine 
       G6
With a full glass and an empty heart
  Dsus2                             Asus2
I search for something to occupy my mind

(Asus2)    Am7      G6     Dsus2

E      C             E
   But you are in my head
 C                     E
Swimming forever in my head
C              E
Tangled in my dreams
 C               C
Swimming forever

D                  G
  So listen to the radio
Bm                       A
    And all the songs we used to know
D                  G
  So listen to the radio
Bm                 A
    Remember where we used to go...

(Asus2)    Am7      G6     Dsus2

         Asus2
Now it's morning light
         Am7
And it's cold outside
G6      
Caught up in a distant dream
  Dsus2                             Asus2
I turn and think that you are by my side

(Asus2)    Am7      G6     Dsus2

     Asus2
So I leave my bed
      Am7
And I try to dress
G6
Wondering why my mind plays tricks 
    Dsus2                          Asus2
And fools me into thinking you are there

(Asus2)    Am7      G6     Dsus2

E      C             E
   But you are in my head
 C                     E
Swimming forever in my head
C              E
Tangled in my dreams
 C               C
Swimming forever

D                  G
