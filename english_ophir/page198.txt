Have you seen the old man 
        C#m        G#m
in the closed-down market
A              E/B
Kicking up the paper
        F#m/A     B
with his worn-out shoes?
E      /B       B
In his eyes you see no pride
C#m              G#m
and held loosely at his side
A             E/B
  Yesterday's paper 
        B7          E       E
telling yesterday's news
 
   A           G#m
So how can you tell me

you're lo  -   nely
F#7/A#
     and say for you
                   B        B
that the sun don't shine?
E/B             B
Let me take you by the hand and 
C#m                  G#m

to make you change your mind

E        /B       B
Have you seen the old girl
    C#m                  G#m
who walks the streets of London
A           E/B
Dirt in her hair
        F#m/A      B
and her clothes in rags?
E        /B       B
She's no time for talking
    C#m                 G#m
she just keeps right on walking
A            E/B
Carrying her home
   B7          E       E
in two carrier bags
 
   A           G#m
So how can you tell me 
       E  /D#  C#m   /B

E                B
In the all-night cafe 
     C#m           G#m
at a quarter past eleven
A          E/B
Same o--ld man
        F#m/A        B
sitting there on his own
E       /B     B
Looking at the world over the
C#m        G#m
rim of his tea-cup
A                 E/B
Each tea lasts an hour
       B7            E       E
and he wanders home alone
 
   A           G#m
So how can you tell me

Have you seen the old man
   C#m               G#m
outside the seaman's mission?
A             E/B
Memory fading with
          F#m/A           B
the medal ribbons that he wears
E             B
In our winter city
          C#m           G#m
the rain cries a little pity
    A                  E/B
For one more forgotten hero 
      B7                 E    E
and a world that doesn't care
 
   A           G#m
So how can you tell me

you're lo  -   nely
