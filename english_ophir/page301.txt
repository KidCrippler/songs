Penny Lane - The Beatles (+2)
Lyrics and Music: Lennonâ€“McCartney

         A         /G#   A/F#   /E      Bm/D  /B    E7
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
         A         /G#    A/F#     /E        Am    Am
of every head he's had the pleasure to have known
            Am/F#               Am/F
And all the people that come and go
         E4           E      E4       E
stop and say hello

       A     /G#  A/F#    /E    Bm/D   /B    E7
On the corner is a banker with a motor car
           A        /G#     A/F#   /E       Am    Am
The little children laugh at him behind his back
       Am/F#               Am/F
And the banker never wears a mac 
       E4             E  D             D!
in the pouring rain,     very strange

      G             G/B            C       C
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
G                 G/B            C
There beneath the blue suburban skies 
          E         E7
I sit and meanwhile back

         A         /G#   A/F#   /E      Bm/D  /B    E7
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour glass 
         A         /G#    A/F#     /E        Am    Am
and in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
          Am/F#                  Am/F
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
        E4           E      E4       E
it's a clean machine

A         /G#   A/F#   /E      Bm/D  /B    E7
A         /G#    A/F#     /E        Am    Am
Am/F#                  Am/F
E4       E           D       D!

      G             G/B            C       C
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
G             G/B              C
     A four of fish and finger pies 
           E         E7
in summer, meanwhile back

           A      /G#    A/F#    /E    Bm/D   /B    E7
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
           A        /G#    A/F#    /E       Am    Am
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
             Am/F#                   Am/F
And though she feels as if she's in a play
       E4       E      E4       E
She is anyway

         A       /G#    A/F#    /E     Bm/D  /B    E7
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
           A     /G#      A/F#     /E     Am    Am
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
            Am/F#          Am/F
And then the fireman rushes in 
         E4            E  D             D!
from the pouring rain,    very strange

      G             G/B            C       C
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
G                 G/B            C
There beneath the blue suburban skies 
          E         E7
I sit and meanwhile back

      A            A/C#            D       D
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A                 A/C#           D     D
There beneath the blue suburban skies
           A
Penny Lane
