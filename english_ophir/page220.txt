Once I had a love   and it was a gas
C#m                                  E
Soon turned out    I had a heart of glass
E                                    C#
Seemed like the real thing,  only to find
C#m                          E      E   E   E
Much mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
C#m                             E
Soon found out, I was losing my mind
E                                        C#
Seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
C#m                          E      E
Much mistrust, love's gone behind

A
