C                        G
    Look into my eyes,      you will see
F                G   
What you mean to me
            C                  G
Search your heart, search your soul
             F                    C         G
And when you find me there you'll search no more

      Dm                      C     Dm
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
          Dm                     C     Dm
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for

   Look into your heart,    you will find
        F                G
There's nothin' there to hide
             C                G
Take me as I am,       take my life
        F                    C    G
I would give it all, I would sacrifice

      Dm                     C        Dm
Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for
        Dm                      C      Dm
I can't help it there's nothing I want more
               C
You know it's true
             G     G            C          C
Everything I do,        I do it for you

        Bb               Eb
There's no love,    like your love
       Bb                   F
And no other,    could give more love
        C                  G
There's nowhere,    unless you're there
        D                  G!
All the time,      all the way  yeah!
