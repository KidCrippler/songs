Take Me To Church - Hozier
Lyrics and Music: Andrew Hozier-Byrne

Em                Am     Em
   My lover's got humor
                      Am      G
She's the giggle at a funeral
                       Am     Em
Knows everybody's disapproval
                           Am     Em
I should've worshipped her sooner
                    Am        Em
If the heavens ever did speak
                    Am         G
She's the last true mouthpiece
                       Am        Em
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
               Am        D
A fresh poison each week
                  C
We were born sick, you heard them say it
 
Em                     Am      Em
   My church offers no absolutes
                              Am      G
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
                        Am      Em
The only heaven I'll be sent to
                  Am       D
Is when I'm alone with you
                 C
I was born sick,   but I love it
C
   Command me to be well
      G     C     G     Cm    G    Cm  G
Aaaaaaaaaa  Aaaaaaamen  Aaaaaamen  A - men

/G  /F#       /F# /F#    Em
              Take me to church
                                               B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
              Am
Offer me that deathless death
          Em                       /A /G
And good God, let me give you my life
/G  /F#    Em
Take me to church
                                              B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
              Am
Offer me that deathless death
         Em                      /A /G    /G /F
And good God, let me give you my life

Em                       Am         Em
   If I'm a pagan of the good times
               Am       G
My lover's the sunlight
                       Am      Em
To keep the goddess on my side
              Am
She demands sacrifice
D
  To drain the whole sea
C
  Get something shiny
Em                         Am          Em
   Something meaty for the main course
                      Am         G
That's a fine looking high horse
                     Am      Em
What you got in the stable?
                        Am
We've a lot of starving faithful
D
  That looks tasty
C
  That looks plenty
C                /G /F#
  This is hungry work

/F#  /F#   Em
Take me to church
                                              B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
              Am
Offer me that deathless death
          Em                     /A /G
And good God, let me give you my life
/G  /F#    Em
Take me to church
                                              B

I'll tell you my sins, you can sharpen your knife
              Am
Offer me that deathless death
          Em                       /A /G   /G /F#
And good God, let me give you my life

C              G                   B        Em
    No masters   or kings when the ritual begins
         C          G                B          Em
There is no sweeter   innocence than our gentle sin
       C           G            B           Em
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
     C         G            B         Em    
Only then I am human   Only then I am clean

/D       /C      Am

 G   C   G    Cm  G    Cm
Oh,  a - men  A - men  Aa-aa-men

/G  /F#       /F# /F#    Em

                                               B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
              Am
Offer me that deathless death
         Em                      /A /G    /G /F
And good God, let me give you my life

Em!
