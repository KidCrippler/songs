A                              C#m               
   When I was younger, so much younger than today               (when, when I was young)
F#m                         D       G   A

F#m                          D      G      A
   My independence seemed to vanish in the haze            (my independ, vanish in the haze)
A                           C#m
   But every now and then I feel so insecure                       (but, now and then)
F#m                                      D     G      A
   I know that I just need you like I've never done before   (I know that I)
