That's Just What You Are - Aimee Mann (+3)
Lyrics and Music: Aimee Mann, Jon Brion

G    Em    Bm    D    x2

G          Em            Bm           D      G
  In our endeavor we are never seeing eye to eye
           Em          Bm          D        G
No guts to sever so forever may we wave goodbye
           Em             Bm              D       G
And you're always telling me that it's my turn to move
       Em                Bm              D         C
When I wonder what could make the needle jump the groove
 
(C)     G/B          Am     Em       D   C
I won't fall for the oldest trick in the book
(C)      G/B               Am       Em     D   C
So don't sit there and think you're off of the hook
(C)  G/B             Am     Em        D
By   saying there is no use changing 'Cause 

C           Am       G      F
that's just what you are
Am          C        G
That's just what you are

(G)     Em            Bm         D         G
Acting steady, always ready to defend your fears
           Em               Bm           D          G
What's the matter with the truth, did I offend your ears
     Em              Bm                D         G
By suggesting that a change might be a thing to try
              Em                Bm          D     C
Like it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guy

(C)      G/B            Am        Em   D   C
It's not like you would lose some critical piece
(C) G/B          Am            Em   D     C
If   somehow you moved   point A to point B
(C) G/B               Am        Em        D
Main-taining there is no  point changing 'Cause  

C           Am       G      F
that's just what you are
Am          C        G      F
That's just what you are

Em             Em7         C         A7
   Now I could talk to you 'til I'm blue in the face
Em          Em7         C           A7         G
   But we still would arrive at the very same place
        G/F#      C            A7         C    C/B  A7
With you running around and me out of the race    ahaha

G   Em   Bm   D   x4
 
C    G/B           Am        Em   D   C
   So maybe you're right   nobody can take
(C)      G/B         Am         Em       D     C
Something older than time   and hope you could make
(C) G/B          Am       Em   D   C
It   better that would    be a mi----stake
(C)       G/B          Am     Em    D   C
   C       G/B     Am     Em    D
So take it just so far
        Am         C        G    F
'Cause that's just what you are
Am          C        G    F
That's just what you are
Am          C        G
That's just what you are
        F            Am         C         G      F
Acting steady always ready to defend your fears
Am          C        G    F
That's just what you are
Am          C        G    F
That's just what you are
Am          C        G!
That's just what you are
