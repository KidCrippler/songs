        A          D D D    A  D D  A
As the snow flies
     C#m
On a cold and gray chicago mornin
  D                 E
A poor little baby child is born  
       A          D D D    A  D D  A
in the ghetto
        A            D D D    A  D D  A
And his mama cries
            C#m
cause if there's one thing that she don't need
  D                 E
Its another hungry mouth to feed  
       A          D D D    A  D D  A
in the ghetto

                  E
People, don't you understand 
                  D       A
The child needs a helping hand
   D                   E                    A
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
               E
Take a look at you and me
            D       A
Are we too blind to see
D            C#m
Do we simply turn our heads
    Bm             E
and look the other way

         A           D D D    A  D D  A
Well the world turns
      C#m 
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose 
D                          E
plays in the street as the cold wind blows  
       A          D D D    A  D D  A
in the ghetto
       A             D D D    A  D D  A
And his hunger burns
       C#m
So he starts to roam the streets at night
       D                          E
and he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight
       A          D D D    A  D D  A
in the ghetto

E
Then one night in desperation 
  D                 A
a young man breaks away
   D            C#m
He buys a gun, steals a car
 Bm                  E
tries to run, but he don't get far

        A          D D D    A  D D  A
And his mama cries
     C#m
As a crowd gathers round an angry young man 
     D                         E
face down on the street with a gun in his hand
       A          D D D    A  D D  A
in the ghetto

       A               D D D    A  D D  A
As her young man dies,
     C#m
On a cold and gray chicago mornin, 
 D                  E
another little baby child is born
       A          D D D       A      D D  A
in the ghetto         (in the ghetto)
       A          D D D       A      D D  A
And his mama cries    (in the ghetto)
       A          D D D       A      D D  A
                      (in the ghetto)
       A          D D D       A  D D  A
       A          D D D       A  D D  A
