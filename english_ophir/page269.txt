Stupid Thing - Aimee Mann

F    Cm   Bb   F   
Gm   Bb   Bb

F           Am         Dm    Bb
Nothing was saving our day
          F          Am
There was nothing to say
        Eb             Bb
but you said something anyway
 F          Am            Dm    Bb
Claiming I stepped out of line
      F             Am
which forced you to leave me
   Eb      Bb
as if that idea was mine
 
Gm             Bb
Oh, you stupid thing
 F
Speaking of course 
        C
as your dear departed
Gm             Bb
Oh, you stupid thing
F
It wasn't me 
     C
that you outsmarted
Gm             Bb
Oh, you stupid thing
            F
stopping it all
          Cm    Bb       F    F
before it even started
 
F          Am           Dm    Bb
I bet you knew it would come 
F                Am
that's just like you
       Eb             Bb
to sit back and just play it dumb
F           Am            Dm    Bb
One word of warning would help
    F         Am
but that sacrifice was made
 Eb       Bb
trying to save yourself

Gm             Bb
Oh, you stupid thing
 F
Speaking of course 
        C
as your dear departed
Gm             Bb
Oh, you stupid thing
F
It wasn't me 
     C
that you outsmarted
Gm             Bb
Oh, you stupid thing
            F
stopping it all
          Cm    Bb       F   F
before it even started

Cm     Bb     Eb  Bb  F!

F            Am         Dm   Bb
Maybe that's just how I am 
   F            Am
to fall where I stand 
       Eb            Bb
or I'm weak for that kind of man
F             Am           Dm    Bb
One who looks helpless and brave
               F      Am
but you turned into a coward 
  Eb                 Bb
I don't care for the parts you saved

Gm             Bb
    you stupid thing
 F
Speaking of course
