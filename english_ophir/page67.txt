When you were here before
                         B
Couldn't look you in the eye
                    C
You're just like an angel
                   Cm
Your skin makes me cry
                 G
You float like a feather
               B
In a beautiful world
              C
I wish I was special
                   Cm
You're so fucking special

           G           B
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         C
What the hell am I doing here
          Cm
I don't belong here

                   G
I don't care if it hurts
                   B
I want to have control
                 C
I want a perfect body
                 Cm
I want a perfect soul
              G
I want you to notice
              B
When I'm not around
                   C
You're so fucking special
              Cm
I wish I was special

           G           B
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         C
What the hell am I doing here

I don't belong here     Oh, oh
