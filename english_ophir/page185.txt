Cant Stop The Feeling - Justin Timberlake

C         Am        F        Am

           C                 Am
I got this feeling inside my bones
        F                             Am
It goes electric wavey when I turn it on
               C                    Am
All through my city, all through my home
             F                              Am
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

           C
I got that sunshine in my pocket
         Am
Got that good soul in my feet
            F                            Am
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
        C                              Am
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
        F                                  Am
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

              Bb/C                   C
And under the lights when everything goes
           Bb/C                      C
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
        Ab/Bb                   Bb
When we move, well, you already know
        Fm7                         Ab/Bb
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

C                                  Am
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
F
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
        Am
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
C
All those things I shouldn't do
        Am
But you dance, dance, dance
    F                                  Am
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
                 C
I can't stop the feeling
        Am
So just dance, dance, dance
                 F
I can't stop the feeling
        Am
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

C                       Am
Ooh, it's something magical
            F                                   Am
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
                C                     Am
I don't need no reason, don't need control
         F                                Am
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
 
                 C
Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
         Am
Got that good soul in my feet
            F                            Am
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
        C                              Am
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
        F                                  Am
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

              Bb/C                   C

I can't stop the feeling
        Am
So just dance, dance, dance
                 C
I can't stop the feeling
        Am
So just dance, dance, dance
                 F
I can't stop the feeling
        Am                  C!
So keep dancing,    come on
