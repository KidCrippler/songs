F        Am   { /B   /C    /D /E}
F        Am        G

    Am              Em
Oh, life is bigger

It's bigger than you
            Am
And you are not me.
                        Em
The lengths that I will go to,
                     Am      Em
The distance in your eyes,
                     Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
         G
I set it up.

                 Am
That's me in the corner,
                 Em
That's me in the spotlight
            Am
Losing my religion.
          Em
Trying to keep up with you.
      Am                          Em
And I don't know if I can do it.
                     Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
                G
I haven't said enough.

  G                        F
I thought that I heard you laughing,
                                          Am   {/B   /C   /D /E}
I thought that I heard you sing.
   F                         Am     G
I  think I thought I saw you try.

      Am                      Em
Every whisper of every waking hour
                   Am
I'm choosing my confessions,
          Em
Trying to keep an eye on you
       Am                                 Em
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
                     Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
         G
I set it up.

         Am
Consider this, consider this,
    Em
The hint of a century,
         Am
Consider this: the slip
     Em
That brought me to my knees failed.
Am
What if all these fantasies
     Em
Come    flailing around?
         Dm              G
Now I've said        too much.

  G                        F
I thought that I heard you laughing,
                                          Am   {/B   /C   /D /E}
I thought that I heard you sing.
   F                         Am     G
I  think I thought I saw you try.

Am     G      F      G

    C               D
But that was just a dream
    C               D
But that was just a dream

                 Am
That's me in the corner,
                 Em
That's me in the spotlight
            Am
Losing my religion.
          Em
Trying to keep a view
      Am                          Em
And I don't know if I can do it.
                     Dm
Oh no, I've said too much,
                G
I haven't said enough.

    F
But that was just a dream
Am  {/B   /C        /D  /E}
Try Cry Why Try
F

       Am
just a dream
       G
