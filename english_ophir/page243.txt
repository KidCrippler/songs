Private Emotion - Ricky Martin (+1)

C     C/B      Am     Am
C     C/B      F      F
C     C/B      Am     Am

              C       C/B
Every endless night
              Am     Am
has a dawning day
              F    C/E
Every darkest sky
            F     G
has shining ray
                 C       C/B
And it shines on you
               Am     Am
Baby can't you see
                F    C/E
You're the only one
                  F     F
who can shine for me

       Am       E
It's a private emotion
     G           D
that fills you tonight
      F                C
And a silence falls between us
       F                 G
As the shadows steal the light
    Am               E
And wherever you may find it
    G           D
Wherever it may lead
          F       G
Let your private emotion
        C  C/B         Am7  Am7
come to me     Come to me
        C  C/B         F
Come to me     Come to me

                  C       C/B
When your soul is tired
                  Am     Am
And your heart is weak
                F    C/E
Do you think of love
               Dm     Dm
As a one way street
                  C       C/B
Well it runs both ways
             Am     Am
Open up your eyes
                F    C/E
Can't you see me here
              Dm     Dm
How can you deny     ohh

           Am       E
It's a private emotion
     G           D
that fills you tonight
      Dm7              C/E
And a silence falls between us
       F                 G
As the shadows steal the light
        Am           E
And wherever you may find it
    G           D
Wherever it may lead
          F       G
Let your private emotion
        C  C/B
come to me

Every endless night

has a dawning day

Every darkest sky
            Dm    Dm
has shining ray
                  C       Am
It takes a lot to laugh
                 Am     Am
As your tears go by 
                    F    C/E
But you can find me here
                     Dm!
Till your tears run dry
 
           Am       E
It's a private emotion
     G           D
that fills you tonight
      Dm7              C/E
And a silence falls between us
       F                 G
As the shadows steal the light
        Am           E
And wherever you may find it
    G           D
Wherever it may lead
          F       G
Let your private emotion
        C  C/B
come to me
          F       G
Let your private emotion
        C  C/B
come to me
