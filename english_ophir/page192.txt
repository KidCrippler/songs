Am    G/B    C    F    X2

             Am  G/B   C           F
You with the sad eyes, don't be discouraged
     F            Am           G
Oh I realize it's hard to take courage
     C                  Dm
In a world      full of people,
C/E                F
you can lose sight of it all
        Am           G
And the darkness   inside you 
         Dm       C
make you feel so small

               F    C      Gsus4          G
But I see your true colors shining through

Show me a smile then, don't be unhappy,
        F             Am           G
Can't remember when I last saw you laughing
   C                    Dm
If this world makes you crazy and 
       C/E           F
you've taken all you can bear
    Am          G
You call me up 
            Dm           C
because you know I'll be there
