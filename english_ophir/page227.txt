When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
  Bb                 Ab         F7/A
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
            Cm                                 Abmaj7     Gm7
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily
Bb         Ab       Am7b5
Joyfully, playfully watching me

              Cm                       Abmaj7    Gm7
But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible
Bb          Ab         F7/A
Logical, responsible, practical
         Cm                              Abmaj7  Gm7
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
 Bb           Ab        Am7b5
Clinical, intellectual, cynical

          Eb                          Am7b5/Eb
There are times when all the world's asleep
                      Abmaj7
The questions run too deep
                  C#   /C   /Bb  /Ab
For such a simple man

           Eb                               Am7b5/Eb
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
                 Abmaj7
I know it sounds absurd
                         C#   /C   /Bb  /Ab
But please tell me who I am

    Cm                               Abmaj7        Gm7
Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical
Bb         Fm7/Ab    F7/A
Liberal, fanatical, criminal
          Cm                              Abmaj7       Gm7
Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're acceptable
   Bb           Fm7/Ab      F7/A
Respectable, presentable, a vegetable!

At night,    when all the world's asleep
                     Abmaj7
The questions run so deep

Who I am
