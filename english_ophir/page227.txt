When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
  Bb         Bb               Ab         F7/A          F7/A
A miracle,        oh it was beautiful, magical
            Cm            Cm                   Abmaj7     Gm7         Gm7
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily
   Bb          Bb            Ab       Am7b5         Am7b5    Am7b5    Am7b5
Oh Joyfully,          O---h playfully watching me

              Cm       Cm              Abmaj7    Gm7           Gm7
But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible
Bb           Bb        Ab         F7/A        F7/A
Logical,        oh  responsible, practical
         Cm          Cm                  Abmaj7  Gm7          Gm7
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
    Bb          Bb         Ab        Am7b5         Am7b5    Am7b5    Am7b5
Oh clinical,        Oh intellectual, cynical

          Eb                          Am7b5/Eb
There are times when all the world's asleep
                      Abmaj7
The questions run too deep
                  C#   /C   /Bb  /Ab
For such a simple man

           Eb                               Am7b5/Eb
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
                 Abmaj7
I know it sounds absurd
                         C#   /C   /Bb  /Ab     C#   /C   /Bb  /Ab
But please tell me who I am

    Cm             Cm                Abmaj7        Gm7         Gm7
Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical
Bb          Bb        Fm7/Ab    F7/A        F7/A
Liberal,         oh fanatical, criminal
          Cm           Cm                 Abmaj7       Gm7            Gm7
Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're acceptable
   Bb           Bb         Fm7/Ab      F7/A         F7/A    F7/A    F7/A
Respectable,         oh presentable, a vegetable!
