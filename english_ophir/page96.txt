{Drums}

(G   G  -  F#m  -  Bm   Bm) x4

A                    C#m       F#m
    I hear the drums echoing tonight
A/E            G/D               Bm/E
She hears only whispers of some quiet 
   F#m  G  G - F#m -  Bm
conversa  -  tion
A                C#m               F#m
    She's coming in twelve thirty flight  
    A/E              G/D
the moonlit wings reflect the stars 
     Bm/E               F#m    G  
that guide me toward salva  -  tion

(G) - G - F#m -  Bm

A               C#m              F#m
   I stopped an old man along the way
A/E                 G/D            Bm/E
Hoping to find some long forgotten words 
           F#m     G  G - F#m -  Bm
or ancient me -  lodies
A               C#m         F#m
   He turned to me as if to say
                 G                   G
Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you

(G) - F#m -  Bm    Bm

Em              C               G        D
   Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Em                         C              G
   There's nothing that a hundred men or more 
           D
could ever do       
Em             C              G   D
   I bless the rains down in  Africa
Em                  C               G
   Gonna take some time to do the things 
         Bm   D    Em     D/F#  G
we never ha--------d       oohooh

A                 C#m            F#m
    The wild dogs cry out in the night
   A/E                G/D              Bm/E 
As they grow restless longing for some solitary 
F#   m  G  G - F#m -  Bm
compa - ny

A               C#m              F#m
    I know that I must do what's right
           A/E         G/D         Bm/E 
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus
          F#m         G  G - F#m -  Bm
above the Se  -  rengeti
A             C#m                F#m
    I seek to cure what's deep inside
                   G                 G
Frightened of this thing that I've become

(G)  -  F#m  -  Bm    Bm

Em              C               G        D

could ever do       
Em             C              G   D
   I bless the rains down in  Africa
Em                 C              G
