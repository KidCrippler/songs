A Horse With No Name - America

Em       D6/9      Em       D6/9

       Em                D6/9
On the first part of the journey
       Em               D6/9
I was lookin at all the life
            Em                  D6/9
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
           Em                 D6/9
There were sand and hills and rings
    Em                     D6/9
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
         Em         D6/9
and the sky with no clouds
    Em                   D6/9
the heat was hot and the ground was dry
        Em              D6/9
but the air was full of sound

     Em9                          Dmaj9
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
        Em9                   Dmaj9
it felt good to be out of the rain
       Em9               Dmaj9
in the desert    you can remember your name
             Em9                Dmaj9
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
Em9       Dmaj9          Em9           Dmaj9
La la   laha   lala la lala       la    la 
Em9       Dmaj9          Em9           Dmaj9
La la   laha   lala la lala       la    la 

      Em              D6/9
After two days in the desert sun
    Em                D6/9
my skin began to turn red
        Em             D6/9
After three days in the desert fun
      Em                 D6/9
I was looking at a river bed
         Em                D6/9
And the story it told of a river that flowed
        Em                  D6/9
made me sad to think it was dead

You see
     Em9                          Dmaj9
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
        Em9                   Dmaj9
it felt good to be out of the rain
       Em9               Dmaj9
in the desert    you can remember your name
             Em9                Dmaj9
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
   Em9       Dmaj9          Em9           Dmaj9
La la la   laha   lala la lala       la    la 
   Em9       Dmaj9          Em9           Dmaj9
La la la   laha   lala la lala       la    la

      Em                  D6/9
After nine days I let the horse run free
           Em                   D6/9
'cause the desert had turned to sea
            Em                  D6/9
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
           Em                 D6/9
there were sand and hills and rings
    Em                          D6/9
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
        Em                D6/9
and the perfect disguise above
          Em            D6/9
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
        Em                  D6/9
but the humans will give no love

You see
     Em9                          Dmaj9
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
        Em9                   Dmaj9
it felt good to be out of the rain
       Em9               Dmaj9
in the desert    you can remember your name
             Em9                Dmaj9
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
   Em9       Dmaj9          Em9           Dmaj9
La la la   laha   lala la lala       la    la 
   Em9       Dmaj9          Em9           Dmaj9
La la la   laha   lala la lala       la    la
