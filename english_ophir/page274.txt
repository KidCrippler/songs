E    F#m    G         G    F#m    E
E    F#m    G         G    F#m    B7

E             Esus4      E7    E7           Esus4    E
   If I could reach the stars,     pull one down for you
E          Esus4  E7     E7               Esus4    E
   Shinin' on  my heart,     so you could see the truth
A            Asus4         A7    A7         Asus4    A
   Then this love I have inside,    is everything it seems
E          Esus4  E7     E7           Esus4   G#7
   But for now I  find,      its only in my  dreams

         F#m7   G#7      C#m
And I can    change  the world
D#m7b5         G#7              C#m
I would be the sunlight in your universe
D#m7b5              G#7             C#m7 Cm7   Bm7
You would think our love was really some-thing good
     A     E/G#     G#m  Gm    F#m                 E
Baby if I  could    cha--------nge   /    /    the world

E       Esus4    E7     E7       Esus4  E
   If I could be king,      even for a  day
E               Esus4   E7   E7             Esus4    E
   I'd take you as my queen.    I'd have it no other way
A          Asus4      A7    A7               Asus4   A
   And our love would rule,     this kingdom we have made
E                Esus4  E7    E7            Esus4   G#7
   Till then I'd be  a  fool,        wishin for the day

         F#m7   G#7      C#m
And I can    change  the world
