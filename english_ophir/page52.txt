Simon & Garfunkel â€“ Sound Of Silence (+1)

Dm
                       C
Hello darkness, my old friend
                           Dm
I've come to talk with you again
                     Bb     F
Because a vision softly creeping
                        Bb      F
Left it's seeds while I was sleeping
        Bb
And the vision
                        F
that was planted in my brain
               Dm       F
Still remains
           C            Dm
Within the sound     of silence

                             C
In restless dreams I walked alone
                         Dm
Narrow streets of cobblestone
                   Bb       F
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
                          Bb       F
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        Bb
When my eyes were stabbed
                       F
by the flash of a neon light
                       Dm      F
That split the night
                C           Dm 
And touched the sound    of silence

                         C
And in the naked light I saw
                           Dm
Ten thousand people, maybe more
                  Bb       F
People talking without speaking
                  B b       F
People hearing without listening
               Bb
People writing songs
                  F
that voices never share
                  Dm      F
And no one dare         
            C             Dm
Disturb the sound      of silence

                         C
Fools said I, you do not know
                       Dm
Silence like a cancer grows
                     Bb          F
Hear my words that I might teach you
                    Bb          F
Take my arms that I might reach you
       Bb
But my words
                      F
like silent raindrops fell
   Dm          F
                   And echoed 
       C                Dm
In the wells         of silence

                          C
And the people bowed and prayed
                     Dm
To the neon God they made
                         Bb      F
And the sign flashed out it's warning
                     Bb     F
In the words that it was forming
                       Bb
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
                          F
Are written on the subway walls
                      Dm      F
And tenement halls          
                     C               Dm
And whispered in the sounds.....  of silence
