Dm    C    Dm    C

Dm         C
   Now and then I think of 
Dm      C        Dm    C   Dm   C
when we were together
Dm               C
   Like when you said you felt so 
Dm    C         Dm   C   Dm   C
happy you could die
Dm        C                  Dm        C
   Told myself that you were right for me
Dm             C              Dm   C
   But felt so lonely in your company
Dm              C
   But that was love and it's an 
Dm       C      Dm       C   Dm   C
ache I still remember

Dm    C    Dm    C
Dm    C    Dm    C
Dm    C    Dm    C
Dm    C    Dm    C

Dm            C
You can get addicted to a 
Dm      C       Dm     C   Dm   C
certain kind of sadness
Dm           C             Dm
   Like resignation to the end
C          Dm   C   Dm   C
Always the end
Dm           C                   Dm       C
  So when we found that we could not make sense
Dm         C                   Dm       C
  Well you said that we would still be friends
Dm           C
  But I'll admit that I was 
Dm       C      Dm   C   Dm   C
glad that it was over
 
Dm         C              Bb     C
   But you didn't have to cut me off
Dm          C              Bb
   Make out like it never happened
         C       Dm
And that we were nothing
    C            Bb        C
And I don't even need your love
        Dm              C
But you treat me like a stranger
         Bb       C
And that feels so rough
Dm     C               Bb      C
   You didn't have to stoop so low
Dm            C                   Bb
   Have your friends collect your records
         C           Dm
And then change your number
  C                  Bb        C
I guess that I don't need that though
Dm                  C           Bb       C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
 
Dm    C    Dm    C
 
Dm                  C           Bb       C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
 
Dm    C    Dm    C
 
Dm                  C           Bb       C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
 
Dm    C    Dm    C
Dm    C    Dm    C
Dm    C    Dm    C
Dm    C    Dm    C


Dm         C
   Now and then I think of
Dm                  C        Dm   C   Dm   C
all the times you screwed me over
Dm              C
   But had me believing it was
Bb               C        Dm   C   Dm   C
always something that I'd done
C
   And I don't wanna live that way
C
   Reading into every word you say
C
   You said that you could let it go
      C
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on 
    C!
somebody that you used to know

Dm         C              Bb     C
   But you didn't have to cut me off
Dm          C              Bb
   Make out like it never happened
         C       Dm
And that we were nothing
    C            Bb        C
And I don't even need your love
        Dm              C
But you treat me like a stranger
         Bb       C
And that feels so rough
Dm     C               Bb      C
   You didn't have to stoop so low
Dm            C                   Bb
   Have your friends collect your records
         C           Dm
And then change your number
  C                  Bb        C
I guess that I don't need that though
Dm                  C           Bb       C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

    Dm    C    Bb       C
Somebody    (I used to know)
    Dm                  C                   Bb          C
Somebody 
(Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
    Dm    C    Bb       C
Somebody    (I used to know)
    Dm                  C                   Bb          C
Somebody 
(Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
 
Dm  C    Bb       C
       I used to know
Dm  C         Bb       C
       That I used to know
Dm  C    Bb       C
       I used to know
    Dm   C   Bb  C
Somebody
