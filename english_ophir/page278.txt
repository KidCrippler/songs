{E guitar}
Am      Em      F       C  G/B
{Drums & bass}
Am      Em      F       C  G/B
 
Am                            Em
    The future teaches you to be alone
    F                        C
The present to be afraid and cold
   F
So if I can shoot rabbits
C                   G       G
Then I can shoot fascists
Am                       Em
       Bullets for your brain today
    F                    C
But we'll forget it all again
          F
Monuments put from pen to paper
C                       G 
Turns me into a gutless wonder

G              Dm
And     if you tolerate this
Am                         G     G
Then your children will be next
           Dm
And if you tolerate this
Am                         G
Then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next

Am      Em      F       C  G/B

Am                    Em
        Gravity keeps my head down
F              C
Or is it maybe shame
   F                C
At be--ing so young and
         G       G
being so vain
Am                   Em
       Holes in your head today
    F         C
But I'm a pacifist
     F                C
I've walked La Rambas but
                G
Not with real intent

G               Dm
And      if you tolerate this
Am                         G       G
Then your children will be next
           Dm
And if you tolerate this
Am                         G
Then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next
 
F          C         G         G
             will be next
Dm         Am        G         G

    F                C
And on the streets tonight
            G        G
An old man plays
     Dm
With news---paper 
Am                    G
cuttings of his glory days

G                  F
And         if you tolerate this
C                          G      G
Then your children will be next
           Dm
And if you tolerate this
Am                         G
Then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next

     F         C        G        G
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   Ahhhhh
      Dm       Am       G        G
Ahhhhhh  Ahhhhhh
     F         C        G        G
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   Ahhhhh
      Dm       Am       G        G
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   Ahhhhh
     F         C        G        G
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   Ahhhhh
      Dm       Am       G        G
Ahhhhhh  Ahhhhhh
