            G    C     G
It's been a hard day's night 
              F              G
and I've been working like a dog
            G    C     G
It's been a hard day's night
             F              G
I should be sleeping Like a log
           C
But when I get home to you
           D
I find the things that you do 
             G    C   G
will make me feel all right

           G    C   G
You know I work all day 
           F                G
to get you money to buy you things
         G                C        G
and it's worth it just to hear you say
             F            G
you're gonna give me everything
          C
So why on earth should I moan 
             D
cause when I get you alone 
              G    C G
you know I'll feel O.K.

When I'm home 
Em                     Bm
everything seems to be right
         G
When I'm home 
Em                     C6
feeling you holding me tight
D
tight, yeah!

            G    C     G
It's been a hard day's night 
              F              G
