The Fool On The Hill - The Beatles
Lyrics and Music: Lennonâ€“McCartney

D6      D6
 
D6                Em/D
day after day,   alone on a hill
    D6                                   Em/D
the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
    Em7              A7                D6                   Bm7
but nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
    Em7               A7
and he never gives an answer

        Dm   Bb/D   Dm            Bb/D
but the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
        C7                       Dm             Dm7    D6
and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round

D6               Em/D
well on the way, head in a cloud
    D6                               Em/D
the man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
    Em7         A7                D6                  Bm7
but nobody ever hears him, or the sound he appears to make
    Em7               A7
and he never seems to notice

        Dm   Bb/D   Dm            Bb/D
but the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
        C7                       Dm             Dm7    D6
and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round

D6      D6      Em/D    Em/D
D6      D6      Em/D    Em/D

    Em7             A7                 D6                    Bm7
and nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
    Em7                A7
and he never shows his feelings
 
        Dm   Bb/D   Dm            Bb/D
but the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
        C7                       Dm             Dm7
and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round
D6            Em/D    D6                          Em/D
  oh          oh      round, round, round, round, round
 
    Em7              A7          D6                     Bm7
and he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fool
Em7           A7
   they don't like him

    Dm   Bb/D   Dm            Bb/D
the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
        C7                       Dm             Dm7     D6
and the eyes in his head see the world spinning round

D6          Em/D
  oh        round, round, round, round and
D6          Em/D
  oh        round, round, round, round and
