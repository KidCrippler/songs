  We're caught in a trap    I can't walk out

    because I love you too much baby
G                     C
  Why can't you see      what you're doing to me
D                    C              D     C  Bm  D7
    when you don't believe a word I say?

  So, if an old friend I know,       drops by to say hello
D                 C             G              G
    would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
G                    C
  Here we go again,     asking where I've been
D                     C                  D       C   Bm  D7
    You can see these tears are real I'm crying

    Let's don't let a good thing die
C                    D
    when honey,  you know I've never
G               C       G         D7! D7! D7! D7!
