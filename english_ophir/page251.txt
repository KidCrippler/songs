Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
D                       A
But he knew it wouldn't last
A                     A
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
D                    A
For some California grass
 
    A          A
Get back,  get back
    D                        A
Get back to where you once belonged
G  D   A          A
   Get back,  get back
    D                        A
Get back to where you once belonged
 
Get back Jojo

Get back,  get back
    D                        A
Get back to where you once belonged
G  D   A          A
   Get back,  get back
    D                        A!
Get back to where you once belonged

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
D                   A
But she was another man
A                        A
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
D                         A
But she gets it while she can
 
    A          A
Get back,  get back
    D                        A
Get back to where you once belonged
G  D   A          A
   Get back,  get back
    D                        A
Get back to where you once belonged
