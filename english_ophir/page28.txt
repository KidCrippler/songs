Cmaj7     D6      Cmaj7      Cmaj7

   D/F#   G   D/F#          Em
An old    man turned ninety–eight
           D/F#      G      D/F#          Em
He won the      lottery and died the next day
       D/F#        G     D/F#       Em
It's a      black fly in your chardonnay
       D/F#      G          D/F#       Em
It's a death row pardon two minutes to late
         D/F#      G            D/F#       Em
Isn't it ironic...    don't you think

            D  G         D       Em
It's like rai––n on your wedding day
            D   G               D       Em
It's a free ri–––de when you've already paid
                D   G             D           Em
It's the good advi––ce that you just didn't take
    F              C               D     D
And who would have thought... it figures

    D/F#         G     D/F#           Em
Mr. play it safe   was afraid to fly
              D/F# G                  D/F#      Em
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
              D/F#        G           D/F#       Em
He waited his whole damn life just to take that flight
           D/F#           G                   D/F#       Em
And as the plane crashed down he thouht "well isn't this nice"
         D/F#      G            D/F#       Em
Isn't it ironic...    don't you think

            D  G         D       Em
It's like rai––n on your wedding day
            D   G               D       Em
It's a free ri–––de when you've already paid
                D   G             D           Em
It's the good advi––ce that you just didn't take
    F              C               D     D
And who would have thought... it figures

     Cmaj7                               D6
Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
                                      Cmaj7                     D6
When you think everything is okay and everything's going right
    Cmaj7                               D6
And life has a funny way of helping you out when
You think everything's gone wrong and
Cmaj7                               Cmaj7
Everything blows up in your face

  D/F#    G                   D/F#          Em
A traffic jam    when you are already late
    D/F#     G            D/F#      Em
A no–smoking sign on your cigarette break
          D/F#          G                  D/F#      Em
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
          D/F#                  G      
It's like meeting the man of my dreams
     D/F#                  Em
Then meeting his beautiful wife

         D/F#      G            D/F#     Em
Isn't it ironic...    don't you think?
           D/F#      G                D/F#               Em
a little too ironic...     and yeah i really do think...

            D  G         D       Em
It's like rai––n on your wedding day
            D   G               D       Em
It's a free ri–––de when you've already paid
                D   G             D           Em
It's the good advi––ce that you just didn't take
    F              C               D     D
And who would have thought... it figures

Cmaj7      D6      Cmaj7      D6
             Cmaj7                                  D6
And yeh well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
Cmaj7                         D6
Life has a funny, funny way
               Cmaj7              Cmaj7
of helping you out –– helping you out
