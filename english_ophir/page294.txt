My Favorite Mistake - Sheryl Crow
Lyrics and Music: Sheryl Crow, Jeff Trott

Bm7  x8

A                Bm
   I woke up and called this morning
A                   Bm
   The tone of your voice was a warning
C                 G              Bm7    Bm7
   That you don't care for me anymore
A                Bm
   I made up the bed we sleep in
A                   Bm
   I looked at the clock when you creep in
C           G           Bm7    Bm7
   It's 6 a.m. and  I'm alone

D          G             Em          C
   Did you know when you go It's the perfect ending
D         G        Em         Em
   To the bad day       I was just beginning
D           G         Em               C           G     C
   When you go all I know is You're my favorite mistake
 
Bm7  x4

A                         Bm
   Well, your friends are sorry for me
A                    Bm
   They watch you pretend to adore me
C             G                 Bm7    Bm7
   But I'm no fool      to this game
A                      Bm
   Now here comes your secret lover
A                  Bm
   She'd be unlike any other
C             G                 Bm7    Bm7
   Until your guilt goes up in flames
 
D              G             Em          C
   And did you know when you go It's the perfect ending
D         G        Em         Em
   To the bad day       I was just beginning
D           G         Em               C           G     C
   When you go all I know is You're my favorite mistake
                      G     
You're my favorite mistake
     Bm            Bb
Well maybe nothin' lasts forever
F              G
Even when you stay together
Bm                Bb
  I don't need forever after
F                  Em
It's your laughter won't let me go
       Em              D
So I'm holding on this way
 
(D)    G       Em       C
D      G       Em       C
D      G       Em       C       G       C

D             G              Em           C
Did you know, could you tell You were the only one
D          G          Em         Em
  That  I  ever       loved
     D    G                Em      C   G  G  C  C
Now  everything's   so    wrong
D        G          Em        C
Did you  see me     walking   by
D       G    Em        Em
Did it  ever make you cry
D    G   Em            C           G     G
             You're my favorite mistake
C            C           G     G
   You're my favorite mistake
C            C           G     G    C    C    Bm
   You're my favorite mistake
