As far as my eyes can see
          Am         G6       Fmaj7      Em7   Fmaj7       Em7   Dm
There are Shadows approaching me
       Cm             G/B    Bb            F/A
And to those I left behind I wanted you to Know
       Fm/Ab            Cm                   Dsus4  D       Gsus4  G7

And some---day            in the mist of time

     when they asked me if I knew you
    Dsus4     D       Gsus4  G7        Ab
I'd smile and say you were a friend of mine
        Bb               Gm             Cm    Cm/Bb
And the sadness would be Lifted from my eyes

    Oh when I'm old and wise

    Heavy words that tossed and blew me

      Like Autumn winds that will blow right through me
