Goodbye Norma Jean 
               A
Though I never   knew you at all 
                     E/G#
You had the grace to hold yourself 
                       A
While those around you crawled 
                        E
They crawled out of the woodwork 
                   A
And they whispered   into your brain 
                    E
They set you on the treadmill 
                              A
And they made you change your name 
 
       B               B7
And it seems to me you lived your life 
       E             A
Like a candle in the wind 
      E
Never knowing who to cling to 
         B
When the rain set in 
      A
And I would have liked to have known you 
          C#m
But I was just a kid 
                       B
Your candle burned out long before 
     A                A  Abm  F#m  E
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough 
                  A
The toughest role   you ever played 
                    E/G#
Hollywood created a superstar 
                           A
And pain was the price you paid 
              E
Even when you died 
       A
Oh the press still hounded you 
              E/G#
All the papers had to say 
                           A
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude 
 
       B               B7
And it seems to me you lived your life 
       E             A
Like a candle in the wind 
      E
Never knowing who to cling to 
         B
When the rain set in 
      A
And I would have liked to have known you

Goodbye Norma Jean
                          A
From the young man in the 22nd row
                                    E/G#
Who sees you as something more than sexual
                       A
More than just our Marilyn Monroe
 
       B               B7
And it seems to me you lived your life
