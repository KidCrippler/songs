There are unsmiling faces and bright plastic chains
      Dm          Am       Dm   Dm/E   Dm/F  
And a wheel in perpetual motion
   Dm/E  Dm         Am        Bb          Dm
And they follow the races and pay out the gains
        Dm         Am       Dm    Dm/E   Dm/F  
With no show of an outward emotion
 
   Dm/E  Asus4         A7               Dm
And they think it will make their lives easier

For God knows, up till now it's been hard
        Dm         Am             Cm            Gm
But the game never ends when your whole world depends

There's a sign in the desert that lies to the west
          Am             Dm             Dm/E  Dm/F  
Where you can't tell the night from the sunrise
   Dm/E  Dm             Am         Bb             Dm
And not  all the king's horses and all the king's men
     Dm            Am/D        Dm     Dm/E    Dm/F 
Have prevented the fall of the unwise

But a    pilgrim must follow in search of a shrine
