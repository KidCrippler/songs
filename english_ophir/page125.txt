A                   C#m       F#m
    I hear the drums echoing tonight
A              G                Bm
She hears only whispers of some quiet 
      F#m  G     Bm
conversa - tion
A               C#m               F#m     
    She's coming in twelve thirty flight  
    A                G        
the moonlit wings reflect the stars 
     Bm7               F#m  G    Bm
that guide me toward salva-tion
A              C#m               F#m
   I stopped an old man along the way
A                   G              Bm
Hoping to find some long forgotten words 
           F#m  G     Bm
or ancient melo-dies
A              C#m         F#m 
   He turned to me as if to say
                G                     Bm
hurry boy, it's waiting there for you

Em              C               G        D
   Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Em                        C              G
   There's nothing that a hundred men or more

could ever do       
Em             C              G   D

G       Bm

A                C#m            F#m
    The wild dogs cry out in the night
   A                  G                Bm       
As they grow restless longing for some solitary 
F#m   G    Bm
compa-ny
A              C#m               F#m
    I know that I must do what's right
           A           G          Bm
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus 
          F#m    G     Bm
above the Serengeti
A            C#m                F#m
    I seek to cure what's deep inside
F#m                G                       Bm
Frightened of this thing that I've become
