Lyrics and Music: David Paich and Jeff Porcaro

{Drums}

(G   G  -  F#m  -  Bm   Bm) x4

A                    E/C#      A/F#
    I hear the drums echoing tonight
A/E            G/D               D/E
She hears only whispers of some quiet 
   Dmaj7/F#  G  G - F#m -  Bm
conversa  -  tion
A               E/C#               A/F#
    She's coming in twelve thirty flight  
    A/E              G/D        
the moonlit wings reflect the stars 
     D/E             Dmaj7/F#  G  
that guide me toward salva  -  tion

(G) - G - F#m -  Bm

A               E/C#              A/F#
   I stopped an old man along the way
A/E                 G/D            D/E
Hoping to find some long forgotten words 
         Dmaj7/F#  G  G - F#m -  Bm
or ancient me -  lodies
A              E/C#         A/F# 
   He turned to me as if to say
                 G                   G
Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you

(G) - F#m -  Bm    Bm

Em              C               G        D
   Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Em                         C              G
   There's nothing that a hundred men or more 
           D
could ever do       
Em             C              G   D
   I bless the rains down in  Africa
Em                  C               G
   Gonna take some time to do the things 
         Bm   D    Em     D/F#  G
we never ha--------d       oohooh

A                 E/C#           A/F#
    The wild dogs cry out in the night
   A/E                G/D              D/E       
As they grow restless longing for some solitary 
Dmaj7/F#  G  G - F#m -  Bm
  compa - ny

A              E/C#              A/F#
    I know that I must do what's right
           A/E         G/D         D/E
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus
        Dmaj7/F#      G  G - F#m -  Bm
above the Se  -  rengeti
A             E/C#               A/F#
    I seek to cure what's deep inside
                     G                 G
Frightened of this thing that I've become

(G)  -  F#m  -  Bm    Bm

Em              C               G        D

Em             C              G   D
   I bless the rains down in  Africa
Em                 C              G
