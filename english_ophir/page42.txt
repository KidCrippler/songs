And I Love Her - The Beatles
 
F#m     F#m     E      E
 
F#m             C#m
     I give her all my love 
F#m               C#m
     That's all I do 
F#m             C#m
     And if you saw my love 
A                   B
     You'd love her too 
  E         E
I love her 
 
F#m              C#m
    She gives me everything 
F#m          C#m
    And tenderly 
F#m             C#m
    The kiss my lover brings 
A                 B
    She brings to me 
      E        E
And I love her 

C#m              B
     A love like ours 
C#m              G#m
     Could never die 
C#m             G#m
     As long as I 
         B        B7
Have you near me 
 
F#m                C#m
    Bright are the stars that shine 
F#m             C#m
    Dark is the sky
F#m             C#m
    I know this love of mine
 A             B
    will never die
      E        E
And I love her
