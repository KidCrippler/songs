D                   Am
Lights go out and I can't be saved
Am                     Em
tides that I tried to swim against
 D               Am
Brought me down upon my knees
Am         Em
oh I beg I beg and plead, singing
D               Am
Come out of the things unsaid
Am             Em
shoot an apple off my head, and a
D            Am
Trouble that can't be named
Am             Em
tigers waiting to be tamed, singing

D     Am      Am     Em

D            Am
Confusion    never stops
Am                Em
closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
D               Am
  come back and take you home
  Am                  Em
I could not stop that she now know, singing
D           Am
  Come out upon my seas
Am                Em
curse missed opportunities, am I
D         Am
   A part of the cure
   Am             Em
or am I a part of the disease, singing

D     Am      Am     Em
     you             are       X4

D      Am      Am      Em      x2

        And nothing else compares
Fmaj7                      C       G
        Oh nothing else compares
Fmaj7                       C       G
        And nothing else compares
