They call the Rising Sun

And it's been the ruin
   D           F  
of many a poor boy
    Am        E        Am
And God     I know I'm one

Now the only thing a gambler needs 
     Am       C    E          E
Is a suitcase and trunk 
        Am   C         D    F
And the only time he's satisfied 
   Am        E     Am
Is when he's on a drunk
