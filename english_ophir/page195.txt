   Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
Dm
   White lightening, bound to drive you wild
Dm
   Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl
Dm
   "Love me tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle
Asus4          A               Gsus4     G
    The way he moved, it was a sin,  so sweet and true
Fsus4      F            Csus4              C

G                    Eb                      Bb7!    A7!
