I Say A Little Prayer - Aretha Franklin
Music and Lyrics: Burt Bacharach, Hal David
 
F#m    Bm           E   A
   D                       C#7
(I say a little prayer for you)

F#m              Bm
    The moment I wake up
             E     A
Before I put on my makeup (makeup)
  D                        C#7
I say a little (prayer for you)
F#m                      Bm
    And while combing my hair, now
                    E       A
And wondering what dress to wear now (wear now)
  D                        C#7
I say a little (prayer for you)

    D                 E
(Forever) Forever (Forever) ever
        C#m       F#m          A7
(you'll stay in my heart and I will love you
    D                  E
(Forever) forever (and ever) ever
   C#m        F#m          A7
We never will part oh, how I'll love you
   D                   E             
(Together) together (together) together
      C#m         F#m          A7
that's how it must be  To live without you
      D                      C#7    C#7
Would only be heartbreak for me

F#m               Bm
    I run for the bus dear
                E       A
While riding I think of us dear (us dear)
  D                        C#7
I say a little (prayer for you)
F#m                    D
    And at work I just take time
                   E       A
And all through my coffee break-time (break-time!)
  D                       C#7
I say a little prayer for you

    D                 E
(Forever) Forever (Forever) ever
        C#m       F#m          A7
(you'll stay in my heart and I will love you
    D                  E
(Forever) forever (and ever) ever
   C#m        F#m          A7
We never will part oh, how I'll love you
   D                   E             
(Together) together (together) together
      C#m         F#m          A7
that's how it must be  To live without you
      D                      C#7    C#7
Would only be heartbreak for me.    (Nobody but me)
 
    D                 E
(Forever) Forever (Forever) ever
        C#m       F#m          A7
(you'll stay in my heart and I will love you
    D                  E
(Forever) forever (and ever) ever
   C#m        F#m          A7
We never will part oh, how I'll love you
   D                   E             
(Together) together (together) together
      C#m         F#m          A7
that's how it must be  To live without you
      D                      C#7    C#7
Would only be heartbreak for me.    (Ooooh-oo-oo-oooh)
 
F#m               Bm
    My darling, believe me (believe me
             E
For me there is no onnnnne
    A      Bm             A                      A
But you.  Please love, be true. I'm in love with you.
                   Bm         A

Say you love me too (answer my prayer) 
Bm         A
Answer my prayer, baby (answer my prayer)
