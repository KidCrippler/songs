Dm            Gm         Dm
    Life is a moment in space 
          Gm      Bb
When the dream is gone 
       C         F      F
It's a lonelier place 
Cm                          Bb
    I kissed the morning goodbye 
        Bb/A Gm
But down inside 
                       A     A
You know we never know why

Dm              Gm         Dm
    The road is narrow and lone 
     Gm        Bb
When eyes meet eyes 
        C            F      F
And the feeling is strong 
Cm                       F
    I turn away from the wall 
   Bb         F
I stumble and fall 
      Bb          A     A
But I give you it all
 
Dm         A        Dm
    I am a woman in love 
        A     Dm
And I'd do anything 
           A       Dm
To get you into my world 
    A        Dm
And hold you within 
       C             Gm
It's a r----ight I defe---nd 
               F
Over and over again 
Dm          Dm        Dm         Dm
What do I do

Dm           Gm       Dm
   With you eternally mine 
   Gm         Bb
In love there is 
   C          F      F
No measure of time 
Cm                            Bb
    We planned it all at the start 
        Bb/D Gm
That you and I 
                     A      A
Live in each other's heart

Dm              Gm     Dm
     We may be oceans away 
    Gm      Bb
You feel my love 
  C             F      F
I hear what you say 
Cm                      F
     No truth is ever a lie
   Bb         F
I stumble and fall
      Bb          A      A
But I give you it all
 
Dm         A        Dm
    I am a woman in love

And I'm talking to you 
           Bb           Ebm
You know I know how you feel 
       Bb        Ebm
What a woman can do 
       C#         Abm
It's a right I defend
