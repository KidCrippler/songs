You’ve got a fast car, I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal, maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better. Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we’ll make something, but me myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car,     I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store managed to save just a little bit of money
We won’t have to drive too far, just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs and finally see what it means to be living

You see my old man’s got a problem he live with the bottle that’s the way it is
He says his body’s too old for working I say his body’s too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him, she wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody’s got to take care of him So I quit school and that’s what I did

You got a fast car, but is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision, we leave tonight or live and die this way

‘Cause I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
    G                          G
The speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
Em                       Em
     The city lights lay out before us
         D                      D 
And your arm felt nice wrapped ‘round my shoulder
    C    Em        D            D
And I        had a feeling that I belonged
    C    Em        D               D           C           D
And I        had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car and we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain’t got a job and I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better, you’ll find work and I’ll get promoted
We’ll move out of the shelter, buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

You got a fast car, and I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I’d always hoped for better thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got not plans I ain’t going nowhere So take your fast car and keep on driving

You got a fast car, but is it fast enough so we can fly away
