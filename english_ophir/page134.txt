Lyrics and Music: Billy Joel

D  Dsus4  D  A    A D  Dsus4  D 

        A7          D             A7             D                     D         G              D       Em7
She can kill with a smile She can wound with her eyes          She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
        A7     D              A7           F#    
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
     Bm             Bm/A                 G            A7            D     Dsus4     D
She hides like a child But shes always a woman to me 

        A7          D            A7          D                                      G               D       G
She can lead you to love She can take you or leave you         She can ask for the truth But she'll never believe
           A7            D           A7           F#    
And she'll take what you give her as long as its free
     Bm           Bm/A            G        A7       D     Dsus4     D     D/C#
She steals like a thief  But shes always a woman to me

Bm   Bm/A  E/G#                         A    A/G#   F#m
Ohhhhhhhhhh..      she takes care of herself
        D           G      G/F#   Em                A7          D     Dsus4     D     D/C#
She can wait if she wants                     Shes ahead of her time
Dm  Dm/C   G7                    C   C/B  Am
Ohhhhhhhhh.. and she never gives out
        F           Bb  Bb/A   E/G#                                A    Asus6   A7
And she never gives in                        She just changes her mind

            A7         D             A7        D
And she'll promise you more Than the garden of eden
            D          G           D                  Em7         
Then she'll carelessly cut you And laugh while you're bleedin'
           A7            D            A7            F#    
But she'll bring out the best And the worst you can be
         Bm         Bm/A            G        A7       D     Dsus4     D
Blame it all on yourself Cause shes always a woman to me

Bm   Bm/A  E/G#                         A    A/G#   F#m

And she never gives in                        She just changes her mind

She is frequently kind And she's suddenly cruel                     She can do as she pleases Shes nobody's fool
        A7         D            A7            F#    
But she cant be convicted She's earned her degree
        Bm           Bm/A         G          D/F#         Em       A7       D    Dsus4    D
And the most she will do Is throw shadows at you But shes always a woman to me
