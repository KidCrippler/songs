C
What else should I be, all apologies
C
What else could I say, everyone is gay
C
What else could I write, I don't have a right
C
What else should I be, all apologies

   In the sun, in the sun I feel as one
F                               G!
   In the sun, in the sun   I'm married
G!
Buried

C
I wish I was like you, easily amused
C
Find my nest of salt, everything is my fault
C
I'll take all the blame, aqua sea foam shame
C
Sunburn with freezer burn
C
Choking on the ashes of her enemies

F
    In the sun, in the sun I feel as one
F                                G
    In the sun, in the sun   I'm married
G         G           G
Buried,   Married,    Buried 

yah, yah, yah, yeah
