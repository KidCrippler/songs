Basket Case - Green Day (+1)

D               A
Do you have the time
   Bm           F#m
To listen to me whine
 G                D
About nothing and everything
         A      A
All at once

D           A
I am one of those
  Bm         F#m
Melodramatic fools
   G            D
Neurotic to the bone
               A      A
No doubt about it

G             A                D      D
  Sometimes I give myself the creeps
G              A                    D   D
  Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
   G                A
It all keeps adding up
  D         C        Bm
I think I'm cracking up
   G          A
Am I just paranoid?
           D   A   Bm   A   D   A   Bm   A
Am I just stoned?

  D           A
I went to a shrink
   Bm         F#m
To analyze my dreams
    G                 D
She says it's lack of sex
                   A        A
That's bringing me down
  D          A
I went to a whore
   Bm               F#m
He said my life's a bore
   G               D
So quit my whining cause
                  A         A
It's bringing her down

G             A                D      D
  Sometimes I give myself the creeps
G              A                    D   D
  Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
   G                A
It all keeps adding up
  D         C        Bm
I think I'm cracking up
   G          A
Am I just paranoid?
            D   A   Bm   A   D   A   Bm   A
Uo yeh yeh yeh

D   A   Bm   A
D   A   Bm   A

 G              A! A! A! A! A! A! A! A! A!
Grasping to control
                 D
So I better hold on

  Sometimes I give myself the creeps

Am I just paranoid?
