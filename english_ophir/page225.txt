You'll take away the biggest part of me

Ooh ooh ooh,   no, baby please don't go

   A love like ours is love that's hard to find
Am7             F       G    C    Bm7 11  E7
   How could we let it slip away?

F9                       Bbm/F          F
   We've come too far to leave it all behind
Am7               F      G        C
     How could we end it all this way?
       Em7                 Am7
When tomorrow comes and we both regret
    Dm             Em Fm
The things we said today
