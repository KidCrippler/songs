Am    E     G    D     F     C     Dm     E   X2

Am                             E                       G                        D
     On a dark desert highway,   cool wind in my hair    Warm smell of colitas,    rising up through the air
F                            C                            Dm
   Up ahead in the distance,   I saw a shimmering light       My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E
        I had to stop for the night  
Am                                        E                             G                                     
        There she stood in the doorway;      I heard the mission bell       And I was thinking to myself,
               D                               F                             C                                       
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"      Then she lit up a candle       and she showed me the way    
Dm                                                E
         There were voices down the corridor,          I thought I heard them say...
 
F                           C                 E7                                           Am
   Welcome to the Hotel California     Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)    Such a lovely face
 F                              C            Dm                                        E
Plenty of room at the Hotel California   Any time of year (Any time of year)   You can find it here

Am                             E                             G                                      D
   Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,  she got the Mercedes bends,   She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys   she calls friends
F                                    C                  Dm                          E
   How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.    Some dance to remember,    some dance to forget
Am                             E                                      G                                                     
   So I called up the Captain,   "Please bring me my wine"  He said,    "We haven't had that spirit here since 
D                         F                                          C  
   nineteen sixty nine"      And still those voices are calling from far away,     
Dm                                          E
   Wake you up in the middle of the night       Just to hear them say...

F                           C                 E7                                           Am
   Welcome to the Hotel California     Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)    Such a lovely face
     F                             C                Dm                                               E
They livin' it up at the Hotel California    What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)  Bring your alibis

Am                          E 
   Mirrors on the ceiling,     The pink champagne on ice  
              G                                    D
And she said      "We are all just prisoners here,    of our own device"
F                                 C                                   Dm                                       
   And in the master's chambers,      They gathered for the feast          They stab it with their steely knives,
         E
But they just can't kill the beast
Am                                 E                           G
   Last thing I remember, I was        Running for the door          I had to find the passage back
        D                     F                                           C
To the place I was before         "Relax, " said the night man,   "We are    programmed to receive.
Dm                                                   E
   You can check-out any time you like,          But you can never leave! "
