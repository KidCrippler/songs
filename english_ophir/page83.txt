Hotel California - Eagles
Lyrics and Music: Don Felder, Don Henley, Glenn Frey

(Am   E   G   D   F   C   Dm   E) x 2

Am                             E
     On a dark desert highway,   cool wind in my hair
G                           D
     Warm smell of colitas,    rising up through the air
F                            C
   Up ahead in the distance,    I saw a shimmering light
Dm
     My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E
     I had to stop for the night  

Am
     There she stood in the doorway
E
     I heard the mission bell
G
     And I was thinking to myself
                D
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
F
     Then she lit up a candle
C
     And she showed me the way    
Dm
     There were voices down the corridor
E
     I thought I heard them say

F                           C
   Welcome to the Hotel California
       E7
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
       Am
Such a lovely face
 F                              C
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    Dm
Any time of year (Any time of year)
        E
You can find it here

Am
     Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
E
     She got the Mercedes bends
G
     She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
D
     She calls friends
F
     How they dance in the courtyard
 C
sweet summer sweat
Dm
     Some dance to remember
E
     Some dance to forget

Am
     So I called up the Captain
E
     "Please bring me my wine", He said
G                                             D
     "We haven't had that spirit here since       nineteen sixty nine"
F                                             C  
     And still those voices are calling from far away
Dm
     Wake you up in the middle of the night
E
     Just to hear them say

F                           C
   Welcome to the Hotel California
       E7
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
       Am
Such a lovely face
     F                             C
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
       Dm
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
           E
Bring your alibis

Am
     Mirrors on the ceiling
E
     The pink champagne on ice, and she said
G                                      D
     "We are all just prisoners here,      of our own device"
F
     And in the master's chambers
C
     They gathered for the feast
Dm
     They stab it with their steely knives
          E
But they just can't kill the beast

Am                                 E
     Last thing I remember, I was      Running for the door
G
     I had to find the passage back
        D
To the place I was before
F
     "Relax, " said the night man
          C
"We are       programmed to receive
Dm
     You can check-out any time you like
    E
But you can never leave!"
