Bm!  Bm!  A  x4
  
Bm      A      F#m      G   X4
 
         Bm      A  F#m                  G     /A        Bm
Do you remember,    chalk hearts melting on a playground wall?
         A       F#m    G                     /A      Bm 
Do you remember, dawn escaped from moonwashed college halls?
         A           F#m            G      /A       Bm
Do you remember, the cherry blossom in the market square?
         A         F#m        G            /A     Bm
Do you remember, I thought it was confetti in our hair
A             F#m      G          Bm
By the way    didn't I break your heart?
         A          F#m            G          Bm
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart 
   A          F#m            G          Bm      A
So sorry    I never meant to break your heart
        F#m   G
But you broke mine.

D         A             G               D 
Kayleigh      is it too late to say I'm sorry
   C              G        D
Kayleigh could we get it together again
D          A              G        D          C         G       D
    I just can't go on pretending     that it came to a natural end
D         A          G           D 
Kayleigh     I never thought I'd miss you
    C            G               D
and Kayleigh I'd hoped that we'd always be friends
D              A                  G         D
   We said our love would last forever,  so how 
       C       G           D
did it come to this bitter end.

C#m!  C#m!  B      x4

         C#m      B  G#m             A          /B      C#m
Do you remember,     barefoot on the lawn with shooting stars
         B       G#m           A        /B      C#m
Do you remember, loving on the floor in Belsize Park
         B       G#m           A      /B     C#m
Do you remember, dancing in stilletos in the snow
         B          G#m          A      /B     C#m
Do you remember, you never understood I had to go
B           G#m       A          C#m
By the way, didn't I break  your heart?
         B      G#m                A        C#m
Please excuse me I never meant to break your heart
   B      G#m              A         C#m      B
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart
       G#m    A
But you broke mine.

D           A         G               D
Kayleigh,      I just want to say I'm sorry
    C                 G        D
but Kayleigh I'm too scared to pick up the phone
D     A                  G      D        C            G      D
   To hear you've found another lover to patch up our broken home
D          A            G                   D
Kayleigh,    I'm still trying to write that love song
   C                 G          D 
Kayleigh it's more important to me now you're gone
D        A                G       D
   Maybe it'll prove that we were right
           C          G     D
Or it will prove that I was wrong
