Hero – Chad Kroeger & Josey Scott 

Abm                           E 
     I am so high, I can hear heaven
Abm                           E  
     I am so high, I can hear heaven
   G          A                 B    
No heaven, no heaven don't hear me
                    G  
And they say that a hero can save us
    A                        B      B
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
                    G
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
A                      E      E     E!
Watch as they all fly away

Abm                                E    
     Someone told me love will all save us
Abm                                      E
     But how can that be, look what love gave us
                G                  A     
A world full of killing and blood–spilling
                 B      B
That world never came
                    G  
And they say that a hero can save us
    A                        B       B
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
                    G
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
A                      E     E
Watch as they all fly away      ohh
 
G     A     B    
G     A     E     E

{quiet}
             G  
Now that the world isnt ending
     A                        B    B
It's love that I'm sending to you
         G
It isn't the love of a hero
    A                          E   E
And that's why I fear it won't do
{loud again}
                    G  
And they say that a hero can save us
    A                        B      B
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
                    G
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
A                      E     E
Watch as they all fly away

                 B            B
As they all fly away

As they all fly away

And they're watching us (Watching us)
                     A
