F#m               C#m7           Bsus2       C#sus4    C#7
     He deals the cards,    as a meditation
F#m              C#m7            Bsus2      C#sus4    C#7
    and those he plays, never suspect
D                                Asus2    C#7
    he doesnt play,      for the money he wins
Dmaj7         Bsus2         F#m
    he doesnt play    for   respect
F#m              C#m7              Bsus2       C#sus4    C#7
    He deals the cards to find the answer
F#m             C#m7       Bsus2       C#sus4    C#7
    the sacred geometry of chance
D                              Asus2       C#7
    the hidden law,       of a probable outcome
Dmaj7             Bsus2         F#m
      the numbers lead a dance

F#m                 C#m7               Bsus2       C#sus4    C#7
    I know that the spades,    are the swords of a soldier
F#m                 C#m7                 Bsus2     C#sus4    C#7
    I know that the clubs are weapons of war
D                                  Asus2          C#7
    I know that diamonds,     mean money for this art
    Dmaj7         Bsus2       F#m
but thats not the shape of my heart

F#m        C#m7             Bsus2       C#sus4    C#7
    He may play the jack of diamonds
F#m        C#m7             Bsus2       C#sus4    C#7
    He may lay the queen of spades
D                        Asus2       C#7
    De may conceal,    a king in his hand
Dmaj7         Bsus2              F#m
      while a memory of it fades

F#m                 C#m7               Bsus2       C#sus4    C#7
    I know that the spades,    are the swords of a soldier

    I'm not a man,    of two many faces
Dmaj7          Bsus2   F#m
    The mask I wear is one
F#m     C#m7                 Bsus2       C#sus4    C#7
    But those who speak know nothing
F#m     C#m7              Bsus2       C#sus4    C#7
    and find out to their cost
D                                     Asus2     C#7
   and those who curse their luck, in too many places
Dmaj7              Bsus2    F#m
     are those who fear are lost
