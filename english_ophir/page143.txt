A            E       F#m    F#m/E
   Would you know my name,
D       A          E         E
   If I saw you in heaven,
A           E      F#m    F#m/E
   Would it be the same,
D       A          E        E
   If I saw you in heaven,

F#m              C#
   I must be strong,
Em           F#
   and carry on,
        Bm             E7
Cause I know I don't belong,
        A
Here in heaven.

   Would you hold my hand 
D       A          E         E
   If I saw you in heaven 
A            E        F#m    F#m/E
   Would you help me stand 
D       A          E         E
   If I saw you in heaven 

F#m              C#  
    I'll find my way,
Em                   F#
   through night and day
        Bm                 E7
Cause I know I just can't stay

Here in heaven

C            G/B      Am
   Time can bring you down 
         D          G    D   Em   D G
Time can bend your knee 
C           G          Am
   Time can break your heart 
         D        G      D
Have you begging please 
         E       E
Begging please
