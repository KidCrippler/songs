F       F
 
F         Em7         A7                Dm        /C
Yesterday     all my troubles seemed so far away   
Bb        C7                      F            /E 
   Now it looks as though they're here to stay
   Dm  G7       Bb F
oh I believe in yesterday
 
F        Em7         A7             Dm          /C
Suddenly     I'm not half the man I used to be 
Bb           C7             F        /E
   there's a shadow hanging over me 
   Dm    G7       Bb  F
oh yesterday came suddenly
 
Em7  A7   Dm  /C  Bb          Gm      C        F
Why  she  had to  go I don't know she wouldn't say
Em7  A7   Dm  /C     Bb         Gm       C     F
I    said something wrong now I long for yesterday
 
F         Em7         A7           Dm           /C
Yesterday    love was such an easy game to play 
Bb       C7              F         /E
   now I need a place to hide away 
   Dm  G7       Bb F
oh I believe in yesterday
 
Em7  A7   Dm  /C  Bb          Gm      C        F
Why  she  had to  go I don't know she wouldn't say
Em7  A7   Dm  /C     Bb         Gm       C     F
I    said something wrong now I long for yesterday
 
F         Em7         A7           Dm           /C
Yesterday    love was such an easy game to play 
Bb       C7              F         /E
   now I need a place to hide away 
   Dm  G7       Bb F
oh I believe in yesterday
 
F    G7       Bb F!  F!
