How can I just let you walk away       Just let you leave without a trace?
        F                G/F               Em7      Am7
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh
           Dm                             G
You're the only one who really knew me at all
Am7                   Bm7                       Csus2                 Dm7
How can you just walk away from me     When all I can do is watch you leave?
             F                   G/F                    Em7             Am7
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain       And even shared the tears
           Dm                             Gsus4    G
You're the only one who really knew me at all

                     C/G                           D7/G
So take a look at me now      Well there's just an empty space
                    Am7            F                Dm7            G
And there's nothing left here to remind me just the memory of your face
                       C/G                                D7/G
Ooh, take a look at me now           Well there's just an empty space
               Am7            F
And you coming back to me is against the odds         
           Dm7              Gsus4  Gsus4  G  G
and that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around        Turn around and see me cry
           F              G/F                  Em7          Am7
There's so much I need to say to you        So many reasons why
           Dm                             Gsus4    G
You're the only one who really knew me at all

                     C/G                           D7/G
So take a look at me now      Well there's just an empty space
                    Am7            F                Dm7            G

Now Take a look at me now         'Cause that's just an empty space
       Am7             F                       Dm7              G
But to wait for you is all I can do and that's what I've got to face
                       C/G                                   D7/G
Take a good look at me now             'Cause I'll still be standing here
               Am7            F
And you coming back to me is against all odds     
         Dm7                Gsus4  Gsus4  G  G 
It's the chance I've got to take
