Wish You Were Here – Pink Floyd

Em    G    Em    G    Em    A    Em    A    G    G

C                            D                   Am                    G
    So, so you think you can tell,   Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
                     D                       C
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, 
               Am                         G
a smile from a veil, Do you think you can tell?
                     C                       D
Did they get you to trade    your heroes for ghosts,
               Am                  G                             D
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change,
              C                                Am                        G
And did you exchange     a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

C                                       D
    How I wish,     how I wish you were here.
           Am                                         G                     
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl,         year after year,
D                                           C
        Running over the same old ground.        What have we found?
             Am                       G
The same old fears.     Wish you were here!


Em    G    Em    G    Em    A    Em    A    G    G
Em    G    Em    G    Em    A    Em    A    G    G     {fade out}
Em    G    Em    G    Em    A    Em    A    G    G
