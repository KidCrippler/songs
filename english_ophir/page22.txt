Hello,  Is there anybody in there?   Just nod if you can hear me           Is there anyone at home?
Bm                        A               G          G/F# Em                   Bm 
Come on now,  I hear your feeling down,   I can ease your pain,    And get you on your feet again
Bm                           A               G         G/F# Em               Bm
Relax,   I'll need some information first,   Just the basic facts,   Can you show me where it hurts?
 
D                             A          D                                 A
   There is no pain you are receding         A distant ship smoke on the horizon
C                                 G              C                                      G
   You are only coming through in waves     Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
     D                     A              D                          A       A - G/B - 
When I was a child I had a fever       My hands felt just like two balloons
C                               G                                    C                             G
Now I've got that feeling once again, I can't explain, You would not understand, This is not how I am
 
A            G/B    C                     G                D
I----------------------            have become comfortably numb.

O.K.      Just a little pinprick      There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!     But you may feel a little sick
        Bm                          A                                 G                 Em
Can you stand up? I do believe it's working, good,   That'll keep you going through the show,

Come on it's time to go.

When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse     Out of the corner of my eye
C                              G                           C                                    G
   turned to look but it was gone   I cannot put my finger on it now   The child is grown, The dream is gone

A            G/B    C                     G                D      D    D
