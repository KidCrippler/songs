Am   D   Fmaj7   G

Am                D
   Is it getting better
Fmaj7                     G
      Or do you feel the same
Am                 D
   Will it make it easier on you now
Fmaj7                      G
      You got someone to blame, you say

C            Am
   One love,    One life
Fmaj7                    C
      When it's one need   in the night
C                 Am
   It's One love,    we get to share it
Fmaj7                    C
      It leaves you baby   if you don't care for it

Am   D   Fmaj7   G

Am             D
   Did I disappoint you
Fmaj7                               G
      Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
Am                         D
   You act like you never had love
Fmaj7                           G
      And you want me to go without

           C           Am
Well, it's   too late,    tonight
Fmaj7                       C
      To drag the past out into the light
C                       Am
   We're one, but we're    not the same
         Fmaj7                     C
We get to     carry each other, carry each other
    Am   D   Fmaj7   G
One

Am                            D
   Have you come here for forgiveness
Fmaj7                             G
      Have you come to raise the dead
Am                             D
   Have you come here to play Jesus
Fmaj7                        G
      To the lepers in your head

C                      Am
   Did I ask too much?    More than a lot?
Fmaj7                               C
      You gave me nothing, now it's   all I got
C                      Am
   We're one but we're not the same
        Fmaj7                          C
Well we       hurt each other then we do it again

You say
C                    Am
   Love is a temple, love a higher law
C                 Am
Love is a temple, love a higher law
    C                     G
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
                       F
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

C            Am
   One love,    One blood
Fmaj7                       C
      One life, you got to do what you should
C            Am
   One life,    with each other
Fmaj7          C
      Sisters,   Brothers
C                      Am
   One life, but we're    not the same
         Fmaj7                     C
We get to     carry each other, carry each other

C   Am    Fmaj7    C
One       One
