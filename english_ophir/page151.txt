B
  Shed a tear cause I'm missing you
F#
  I'm still alright to smile
G#                             C#           C#
  Girl I think about you every day now
B
  Was a time when I wasn't sure
        F#
But you    set my mind at ease
G#                                C#          C#
  There is no doubt, you're in my heart now

B             F#
  Said woman, take it slow
      B                Ebm
It'll work itself out fine
B              F#              C#       C# 
All we need is just a little patience
B             F#
  Said sugar, make it slow and
      B              Ebm
It'll come together fine
B              F#              C#       C# 
All we need is just a little patience

      uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
C#    C#
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

B
  I sit here on the stairs
          F#
Cause I'd    rather be alone
   G#
If I can't have you right now
      C#          C# 
I'll wait, dear
B
  Sometimes I get so tense
      F#
But I can't speed up the time
    G#
But you know love, there's one more thing
       C#      C# 
To consider

B             F#
  Said woman, take it slow
    B                    Ebm
And things will be just fine
B                 F#             C#       C# 
You and I’ll just use a little patience
B             F#
  Said sugar, take the time
          B                  Ebm
Cause the lights are shining bright
B                F#                 C#       C# 
You and I've got what it takes to make it
         C#            C#
We won't fake it
                  C#          C#
Ahh,   I'll never break it
               C#           C#
 Cause I can't take it

F#               F#
  Just trying to get it right
C#                         C#
  It's hard to see with so many around
    F#                       F#
You know I don’t like being stuck in the crowd
        C#                       C# 
And the streets don't change but baby the names
F#              F#
    I ain't got time for the game
        C#        C#                F#        F#
Cause I need you  Yeah yeah, well I need you
