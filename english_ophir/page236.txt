Black - Pearl Jam
Lyrics: Eddie Vedder   Music: Stone Gossard

E          A          E          A          E          A          E          E

E               A                   E               A
Sheets of empty canvas,   untouched sheets of clay
     E                 A                E             E
Were laid spread out before me   as her body once did
E             A                    E               A
A---ll five horizons     revolved around her soul 
(as the earth to the sun)
E             A                         E             E
Now the air I tasted and breathed   has taken a turn

     C                                    E
Uhhhhh, and all I taught her was     everything
     C                                  E
Uhhhhh, I know she gave me all     that she wore

           D                        C
And now my bitter hands     Chafe beneath the clouds
                 Em
Of what was everything
        D                          C
All the pictures have     all been washed in black
               Em
Tattooed everything

E           A                    E                A
   I take a walk outside,  I'm surrounded by some kids at play
E                A                 E              E
I can feel their laughter      so, why do I sear

    C                                           E
Mmmmm, and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head
(I'm spinning)
        C                                       E
Oh I'm spinning, how quick the sun can    drop away

           D                        C
And now my bitter hands     Cradle broken glass
                E
Of what was everything
        D                         C
All the pictures have    All been washed in black
              E
Tattooed everything
        D                           C
All the love gone bad     Turned my world to black
             D                  C               E
Tattooed all I see,    All that I am,  All I'll be  

D        C         E
         Yeah      Uh
D        C          E
Uh       Oh      I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
  D                          C                          E
I know you'll be a star   in somebody else's sky    But why why
D                C                              E  D  C    E
why     can't it be,       Why can't it b----e mi-----ne

                      D
'Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo
                      C
'Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo
                      E
'Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo
