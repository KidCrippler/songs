 Am              Em
Standing in line marking time
D               C             G
Waiting for the welfare dime
       D          C
'Cause they can't buy a job
    Am                   Em
The man in the silk suit hurries by
      D                C             G
As he catches the poor ladies' eyes
         D           C
Just for fun he says    get a job

G       Fmaj7   C                    C

G       Fmaj7   C                       C
                        Somethings will never change
G       Fmaj7   C                       C
                        That's just the way it is

They say hey little boy you can't go 
          D            C       G
where the others go
                 D         C
'Cause you don't look like they do
     Am          Em
Said hey old man how can you stand 
   D             C        G  
to think that way
        G            D                   C
Did you really think about it before you made the rules
he said, son

G       Fmaj7   C                       C
                        That's just the way it is

Well they passed a law in '64 
   D                    C                 G
To give those who ain't got a little more
       D            C
But it only goes so far 
            Am                Em
because the law don't change another's mind
     D                  C        G
When all it sees at the hiring
            D           C
time is the line on the color bar
 
G       Fmaj7   C                       C

G       Fmaj7   C                       C
