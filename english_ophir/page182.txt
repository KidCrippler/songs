 Am              Em7
Standing in line marking time
 D               C             G
Waiting for the welfare dime
         D              C9    C9
'Cause they can't buy a job
    Am                   Em7
The man in the silk suit hurries by
       D                    C            G
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
          D           C9
Just for fun he says     get a job

G   Fmaj7   C9                  C9 
                That's just the way it is
G   Fmaj7   C9                   C9
                Some things will never change
G   Fmaj7   C9                  C9
                That's just the way it is

     Am             Em7
Said hey little boy you can't go 
          D            C       G
where the others go
                  D         C9       C9
'Cause you don't look like they do
     Am          Em7
Said hey old man how can you stand 
     D             C
to think that way
G                            D           C9
Did you really think about it before you made the rules

          G   Fmaj7   C9                    C9 
He said, son                That's just the way it is
G   Fmaj7   C9                   C9
                Some things will never change
G   Fmaj7   C9                  C9
                That's just the way it is
G   Fmaj7   C9          C9             Am      -->
                Ah, but don't you believe them

          Am              Em7
Well they passed a law in '64 
    D                    C                 G
To give those who ain't got a little more
       D            C9   C9
But it only goes so far 
           Am               Em7
'Cause the law don't change another's mind
     D                   C          G
When all it sees at the hiring time
        D          C9
is the line on the color bar
 
G   Fmaj7   C9                  C9 
                That's just the way it is
G   Fmaj7   C9                   C9
                Some things will never change
G   Fmaj7   C9                  C9
                That's just the way it is
G   Fmaj7        C9
          That's just the way it is, it is....
