     Gm               Cm  Gm
They call me the wild ro--se
       Bb             D
But my name was Eliza Day
         Gm                    Cm   Gm
Why they call me that I do not kno--w
       Gm       F     Gm
For my name was Eliza Day

         Gm
From the first day I saw her 
       Bb
I knew she was the one
     Cm                    D
She stared in my eyes and smiled
    Gm
Her lips were the colour 
       Bb
of the roses
      Cm
That grew down the river
     D
All bloody and wild
 
         Gm
When he knocked on my door
    Bb
And entered the room
    Cm
My trembling subsided 
   D
in his sure embrace
         Gm
He would be my first man
           Bb
And with a careful hand
   Cm
He wiped up the tears
     D                  D
That ran down my face

     Gm               Cm  Gm
They call me the wild ro--se
       Bb             D
But my name was Eliza Day

Why they call me that I do not kno--w
       Gm       F     Gm
For my name was Eliza Day

       Gm
On the second day
                 Bb
I brought her a flower
              Cm
She was more beautiful
         D
Than any woman I've seen
  Gm
I said do you know
          Bb
Where the wild roses grow
Cm
So sweet and scarlet 
     D
and free
 
       Gm
On the second day he came
       Bb
With a single red rose
        Cm
He said Give me your loss 
         D
and your sorrow
  Gm
I nodded my head
     Bb
As I lay on the bed
     Cm
If I show you the roses 
         D         D
will you follow

     Gm               Cm  Gm
They call me the wild ro--se
       Bb             D
But my name was Eliza Day

For my name was Eliza Day

       Gm
On the third day 
                  Bb
he took me to the river
   Cm
He showed me the roses
       D
And we kissed
        Gm
And the last thing I heard
      Bb
Was a muttered word
   Cm
As he knelt above me
       D
with a rock in his fist

       Gm
On the last day I took her
          Bb
Where the wild roses grow
    Cm
She lay on the bank
         D
The wind light as a thief
      Gm
And I kissed her goodbye
         Bb
Said all beauty must die
      Cm
And I leant down and planted
  D                      D
a rose 'tween her teeth

     Gm               Cm  Gm
They call me the wild ro--se

But my name was Eliza Day
