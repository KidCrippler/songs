Chasing Pavements - Adele
Lyrics and Music: Adele Adkins, Eg White

Cm    Bb6

     Cm                     Bb6
I've made up my mind, don't need to think it over
        Ab                     G7
If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further
           Ab       Bb6  Bb7    Eb   Cm   Gm7
This ain't lust, I know this is love      But
   Eb                   Bb6/D
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
              Cm 
'Cause it was not said to you
            G7/B                        Ab
And that's exactly what I need to do if I'd 
        Bb6
e----nd up      with you

Ab                Gm7    Cm       Fm                Ab    
Should I give up      or should I just keep chasing pavements
Ab         Gm7     G7
Even if it leads nowhere
   Ab            Gm7   Cm   Fm            Ab    
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
         Ab       G7
Should I leave it there?
Ab                Gm7    Cm       Fm                Ab    
Should I give up      or should I just keep chasing pavements
Ab               Gm7            Gm7   Eb
E---ven if it    leads nowhere?
 
  Cm                      Gm7
I build myself up    and fly around in circles
        Ab                        G7
Waiting as my heart drops  and my back begins to tingle
    Ab                 Bb6
Finally     could this be   it?   Or

Ab                Gm7    Cm       Fm                Ab    
Should I give up      or should I just keep chasing pavements
Ab         Gm7     G7
Even if it leads nowhere
   Ab            Gm7   Cm   Fm            Ab    
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
         Ab       G7
Should I leave it there?
Ab                Gm7    Cm       Fm                Ab    
Should I give up      or should I just keep chasing pavements
Ab               Gm7            Gm7   Eb
E---ven if it    leads nowhere?       Yeah

Ab                           Gm7
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
     Fm7           Bb6
Even if it leads nowhere?
            Ab                  G7
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
                  F7            Bb
Should I leave it there? Should I give up?
            Ab            Gm7 Cm      Fm  
Or should I just  keep on,    chasing    pavements
Ab          Gm7          Cm          Fm            Ab
   Should I just keep on     chasing    pavements?
Ab      Bb7

Ab                Gm7    Cm       Fm                Ab

Ab         Gm7     G7
Even if it leads nowhere
   Ab            Gm7   Cm   Fm            Ab    
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
         Ab       G7
Should I leave it there?
Ab                Gm7    Cm       Fm                Ab
