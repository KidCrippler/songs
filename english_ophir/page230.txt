Em         D         Cmaj7       B7
Em7        D#°       F#°         B
Em7        D         Cmaj7       B7
Em         Am7       Em          Em

Em/G              D               Cmaj7             B7
   The problem is all inside your head, she said to me
Em7              D#°         F#°           B
   The answer is easy if you take it logically
Em7            D                 Cmaj7          B7
   I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
                 Em        Am7                Em       Em
   There must be     fifty ways to leave your lover
 
Em/G              D             Cmaj7       B7
   She said: It's really not my habit to intrude
       Em            D#°               F#°             B
Furthermore I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
           Em            D          Cmaj7          B7
But I'll repeat myself,      at the risk of being crude
              Em         Am7                Em        Em
There must be      fifty ways to leave your lover
Em         Am7                Em        Em
     Fifty ways to leave your lover

                  G                         Bb
Just slip out the back Jack,    make a new plan Stan
                    C7                              G
You dont need to be coy Roy,     just get yourself free
           G                                Bb
Hop on the bus Gus,    you don't need to discuss much
                  C7                             G
Just drop off the key Lee,     and get yourself free
                G                         Bb
Uh slip out the back Jack,    make a new plan Stan
              C7                              G
No need to be coy Roy,     you just listen to me
           G                                Bb
Hop on the bus Gus,    you don't need to discuss much

Em/G             D               Cmaj7           B7
   She said: It grieves me so to see you in such pain
             Em                   D#°    F#°       B
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
          Em       D              Cmaj7               B7
I said: I   appreciate that   and would you please explain
                Em         Am7           Em
about the Fifty ways
 
Em/G            D                   Cmaj7        B7
  She said: Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
        Em              D#°               F#°                 B
And I believe     in the morning you'll begin to see the light
             Em              D             Cmaj7        B7
And dhen she kissed me and I realised, she probably was right
                Em        Am7                Em        Em
There must be       fifty ways to leave your lover
Em         Am7                Em
