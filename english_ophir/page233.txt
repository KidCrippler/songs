American Pie - Don McLean

{Verses 3 to 5 were removed to shorten the song}

  G      D/F#   Em7
A long,  long   time ago
Am             C
 I can still remember how that 
    Em                    D
music used to make me smile
    G      D/F#  Em7
And I knew if  I had my chance
     Am                 C
That I could make those people dance
    Em              C                 D
and maybe they'd be happy for a while
Em               Am
    But February made me shiver
Em                   Am
    with every paper I'd deliver
C        G/B    Am
Bad news on the doorstep
C                            D
I couldn't take one more step
   G      D/F#   Em
I can't remember if I cried when 
  Am7            D
I read about his widowed bride
G           D/F#       Em
  Something touched me deep inside
 C          D7    G!
The day the music died...

   G    C        G        D
So bye, bye Miss American Pie
         G            C            G        D
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
         G        C                  G           D
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
        Em                          A7
Singin' this will be the day that I die
Em                          D7    D7
this will be the day that I die

G                     Am
    Did you write the book of love
       C                 Am
And do you have faith in god above
Em              D             D
   if the bible tells you so?
G           D/F#     Em
   Do you believe in rock and roll
    Am7                C
Can music    save your mortal soul and
Em                 A7               D
   can you teach me  how to dance real slow?
       Em                   D
Well I know that you're in  love with him
       Em                 D
'cuz I saw you dancin'    in the gym
    C           G/B      A7
You both kicked off your shoes
      C                    D7
man I dig those rhythm and blues
        G      D/F#     Em
I was a lonely teenage bronckin' buck
       Am                   C
with a pink carnation and a pickup truck
  G      D/F#    Em
But I knew I was out of luck
    C           D7    G     C
the day     the music died
G
    I started singin'

G    C        G        D
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
         G            C            G        D
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
     G        C                  G           D
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
        Em!                         A7!
Singin' this will be the day that I die
Em!                          D7    D7
this will be the day that I die

{Quiet}
  G     D/F#     Em
I met a girl who sang the blues
      Am                 C
And I asked her for some happy news
    Em                  D           D
But she just smiled and turned away
G      D/F#        Em
I went down to the sacred store
      Am                  C
Where I'd heard the music years before
        Em                 C
but the man there said the music
         D     D
wouldn't play
    Em                 Am
But in the streets the children screamed
    Em                   Am
the lovers cried and the poets dreamed
    C     G/B      Am
But not a word was spoken
    C                      D
the church bells all were broken
        G         D/F#  Em
And the three men I admire most
    Am7     C            D7
the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
G                  D/F#       Em
   They caught the last train for the coast
    C          D7    G
the day    the music died

And they were singin'

G    C        G        D
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
         G            C            G        D
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
     G        C                  G           D
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
        Em!                         A7!
Singin' this will be the day that I die
Em!                          D7    D7
this will be the day that I die

{More rythm}
G    C        G        D
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
         G            C            G        D
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
     G        C                  G           D
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
        C                D          G  C  G
Singin' this will be the day that I die
