Dancing In The Dark - Bruce Springsteen
Lyrics and Music: Bruce Springsteen

B      Abm      B      Abm
B      Abm      B      Abm

B                  Abm         B
   I get up in the evening
                Abm        B
and I ain't got nothing to say
                   Abm          B
I come home in the morning
            Abm              E
I go to bed feeling the same way
                    C#m       E
I ain't nothing but tired
              C#m                    B
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
          Abm      B
Hey there baby
        Abm               F#
I could use just a little help
 
                  B  F#
You can't start a f--ire
                                 E
You can't start a fire without a spark
               C#m            E
This gun's for hire
                   C#m            B
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

(B)    Abm      B      Abm
 
B                          Abm         B
    Message keeps getting clearer
                   Abm               B
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
                       Abm         B
I check my look in the mirror
                   Abm                 E
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
                     C#m              E
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
         C#m                   B
I'm just living in a dump like this
                            Abm            B
There's something happening somewhere
             Abm             F#
Baby, I just know that there is

                  B  F#
You can't start a f--ire
                                 E
You can't start a fire without a spark
               C#m            E
This gun's for hire
                   C#m            B
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

(B)    Abm      B      Abm
B      Abm      B      Abm
 
Abm                         B
     You sit around getting older
E                         F#                Abm
  There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
                             B
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
E                     F#
    Come on baby, the laugh's on me
 
B                        Abm           B
  Stay on the streets of this town
               Abm              B
and they'll be carving you up alright
                        Abm            B
They say you gotta stay hungry
              Abm                   E
Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight
                   C#m        E
I'm dying for some action
                           C#m                       B
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
                Abm        B
I need a love reaction
                  Abm            F#
Come on now baby, gimme just one look

                  B  F#
You can't start a f--ire
                                    E
Sittin' 'round cryin' over a broken heart
               C#m            E
This gun's for hire
                   C#m            F#
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
                  B  F#
You can't start a f--ire
                                          E
Worryin' about your little world fallin' apart
               C#m            E
This gun's for hire
                   C#m            B
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

(B)    Abm      B                       Abm            B
                     Even if we're just dancing in the dark
(B)    Abm      B                       Abm            B
                     Even if we're just dancing in the dark
(B)    Abm      B                       Abm            B
                     Even if we're just dancing in the dark
