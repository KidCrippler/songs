While My Guitar Gently Weeps - Beatles

Am   Am/G   Am/F#   Fmaj7   Am    G    D    E

  Am          Am/G         Am/F#            Fmaj7
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
Am              G          D        E
    While my guitar gently weeps
  Am          Am/G         Am/F#       Fmaj7
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Am              G          C        E
    Still my guitar gently weeps

A              C#m  F#m        C#m
  I don't know why      nobody told you
Bm                     E     Esus4    E
    How to unfold your love
A              C#m  F#m            C#m
  I don't know how      someone controlled you
Bm                       E    Esus4    E
    They bought and sold you

  Am          Am/G         Am/F#      Fmaj7
I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
Am              G          D        E
    While my guitar gently weeps
     Am       Am/G         Am/F#    Fmaj7
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Am              G          C        E
    Still my guitar gently weeps

Am   Am/G   Am/F#   Fmaj7   Am   G   D   E
Am   Am/G   Am/F#   Fmaj7   Am   G   C   E

A              C#m  F#m            C#m
  I don't know how      you were diverted
Bm                     E   Esus4   E
    You were perverted too
A              C#m  F#m            C#m
  I don't know how      you were inverted
Bm                 E   Esus4   E
    No one alerted you

  Am          Am/G         Am/F#            Fmaj7
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
Am              G          D         E
    While my guitar gently weeps
Am          Am/G       Am/F#       Fmaj7
Look at you all...
Am              G          C       E
    Still my guitar gently weeps

Am   Am/G   Am/F#   Fmaj7   Am   G   D   E
