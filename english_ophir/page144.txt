   Blue jean baby,    L.A. lady,    seamstress for the band
C         F/C   C         F/C    C                       F/A   F/A G
   Pretty eyed,    pirate smile,    you'll marry a music man
F       Em7   Am               D/F#      Dm7     E7             Am    G7/B
   Ballerina,    you must have seen her,         dancing in the sand
C            F/C     C         F/C      C                   G - F - Em - Dm
   Now she's in me,     always with me,   tiny dancer in my hand

C    F/C    C    F/C
 
C         F/C   C            F/C    C                         F/A     F/A G/B
   Jesus freaks,  out in the street,  handing tickets out for God
C          F/C  C          F/C    C                           F/A   F/A G
   Turning back,  she just laughs,  the boulevard is not that bad
F        Em7   Am             D/F#    Dm7        E7     Am    G7/B
   Piano man,    he makes his stand,      in the auditorium
C          F/C  C                F/C   C                                   G - F - Em - Dm
   Looking on,     she sings the songs,  the words she knows, the tune she hums

C    F/C    C    C

Ab               Bb              Gm               Cm
   But oh how it feels so real   Lying here, with no one near

Only you,        and you can hear me    When I say, "Softly..."    "Slowly..."

   Lay me down in sheets of linen               You had a busy day today
