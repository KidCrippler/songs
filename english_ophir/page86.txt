Speed Of Sound - Coldplay

A     Em     Em     D
A     Em     Em     D

    A                 Em
How long before I get in 
                             D
Before it starts, before I begin 
    A                 Em
How long before you decide 
                            D
Before I know what it feels like 
      A              Em
Where to, where do I go 
                                      D
If you never tried then you'll never know 
    A                  Em
How long do I have to climb 
                                    D
Up on this side of this mountain of mine 

A     Em     Em     D
A     Em     Em     D

     A                Em
Look up, I look up at night 
                                   D
Planets are moving at the speed of light 
     A             Em
Come up, up in the trees 
                                          D
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize 
    A               Em
How long am I gonna stand
                             D
With my head stuck under the sand 
      A                        Em
I'll start before I can stop 
                                     D
or before I see things the right way up 

G            A               Bm
    All that noise, all that sound 
G              A                Bm
    All those places that i got found 
    G                       Bm
And birds go flying at the speed of sound 
   D                 G
to show how it all began 
G                          Bm
Birds come flying from the underground 
             F#m                     G        G
If you could see it then you'd understand 

A     Em     Em     D
A     Em     Em     D

 A                      Em
Ideas that you'll never find
                                D 
all the inventors could never design
    A                      Em 
the buildings that you put up 
                          D
Japan and China   all lit up 
    A                    Em
the sign that I couldn't read 
                              D
all the light that I couldn't see 
    A                    Em
somethings you have to believe 
                                 D
but others are puzzles, puzzling me 

G            A               Bm
    All that noise, all that sound 
G              A                Bm
    All those places that i got found 
    G                               Bm
And birds go flying at the speed of sound 
    D                G
to show how it all began 
G                          Bm
Birds come flying from the underground 
             F#m               G
If you could see it then you'd understand 
             F#m                G         G
Ooh when you see it you'd understand 

D      D      D      D

G            A                        Bm
   all those signs   I knew what they meant 
              E
something you can't invent 
G           A                   Bm
   Some get made,  and some get sent
  E
ooh

    G                       Bm
And birds go flying at the speed of sound 
   D                 G
to show how it all began 
G                          Bm
Birds come flying from the underground 
             F#m                     G
If you could see it then you'd understand 
             F#m                G      G   G   G   G
Ooh when you see it you'd understand
