A                    Am
    I'm not in love,     so don't forget it
G#m7            G#7             C#m            C#m7
    It's just a silly phase I'm going through
A                     Am
    And just because      I call you up
G#m7             G#7                      C#m           C#m7
    Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
A                      B
I'm not in love,    no-no
B7     E      A  G  A
It's because

A                       Am
    I like to see you,      but then again
G#m7            G#7                 C#m         C#m7
    That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
A                     Am
    So if I call you,     don't make a fuss
G#m7                G#7              C#m        C#m7
    Don't tell your friends about the two of us

A                        B
I'm not in love,      no-no
B7     E      Amaj7  E   Amaj7  E   Amaj7   B   /C
It's because

A                        Am
    I keep your picture      upon the wall
G#m7          G#7                C#m          C#m7
    It hides a nasty stain that's lyin' there
A                       Am
    So don't you ask me     to give it back
G#m7            G#                       C#m          C#m7
    I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me

A                           B
    I'm not in love,     no-no
B7     E      A  E
It's because

Am          D7                   G       Em
Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Am          D7                 E4    E
Ooh, you'll wait a long time
Am          D7                   G       Em
Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Am          D7                 E4    E
Ooh, you'll wait a long time

A                      Am
    I'm not in love,       so don't forget it
G#m7           G#7             C#m             C#m7
    It's just a silly phase I'm going through
A                     Am
    And just because      I call you up
G#m7             G#7                      C#m          C#m7
    Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
 
A
     I'm not in love
Am
      I'm not in lo-ve.
