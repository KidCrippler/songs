And then the pun-ches flew
                 Cm     D7  Gm
And chairs were smashed in  two

Her name is Lola        She was a showgirl
             Am7          D7
But that was thirty years ago
          Gm7
When they used to have a show

Now it's a disco       But not for Lola
             Am7               D7
Still in the dress she used to wear
      Gm7
Faded feathers in her hair
               Cm  D7  Gm
She sits there so  re--fined
              Cm   D7    Gm
And drinks herself half-blind
             Cm                     D7
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
          Gm7    Gbm7   Fm7
