Another Day In Paradise - Phil Collins (+1)

Em    Em    D    Am7 
Em    Em    D    Am7 
Em    Em    D    Am7 
Em    Em    D    Am7 

Em7                     D          Am7
   She calls out to the man on the street
Em7                            D
                 "Sir, can you help me?
Em7                      D           Am7
    It's cold   and I've nowhere to sleep
Em7                           D
   Is'there somewhere you can tell me?"
Em7                     D            Am7
    He walks on,        doesn't look back
Em7                      D
    He pretends he can't hear her
Em7                          D            Am7
    Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Em7                      D
    Seems embarrassed to be there

Em7             D/E
Oh,      think twice
                C/E
'cause it's an other day for
              D/E
You and me in paradise
Em7            D/E
Oh,     think twice
               C/E
'cause it's an other day for you
D       Em    D  C
You and me in pa-ra-dise
  
Em    Em    D    Am7 
Em    Em    D    Am7 
                      think about it
Em    Em    D    Am7 
Em    Em    D    Am7 

Em7                      D          Am7
    She calls out to the man on the street
Em7                        D
    He can see she's been crying
Em7                           D            Am7
    She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
Em7                           D
    She can't walk but she's trying

Em7             D/E
Oh,      think twice
                C/E
'cause it's an other day for
              D/E
You and me in paradise
Em7            D/E
Oh,     think twice
        C/E
it's an other day for you
D       Em    D  C
You and me in pa-ra-dise

Em    Em    D    Am7 
Em    Em    D    Am7 
                     just think about it
Em    Em    D    Am7 
Em    Em    D    Am7 

D/F#           Em
            Oh lord
         D                     G
is there nothing more anybody     can do
D/F#           Em
Oh-oh       oh lord
              D                 G      G
there must be something you can say

Em7                       D            Am7
    You can tell from the lines on her face
Em7                        D
    You can see that she's been there
 Em7                         D     Am7
Probably been moved on from every place
Em7                    D
    But she didn't fit in there

Em7             D/E
Oh,      think twice
                C/E
'cause it's an other day for
              D/E
You and me in paradise
Em7            D/E
Oh,     think twice
        C/E
it's an other day for you
D       Em    D  C
You and me in pa ra dise

Em    Em    D    Am7 
                  just think about it
Em    Em    D    Am7 
                   mmmm
Em    Em    D    Am7
                 think about it
Em    Em    D    Am7    Am
