   Another turning point, A fork stuck in the road
G                                 C                 D
   Time grabs you by the wrist, Directs you were to go
Em             D            C                   G
   So make the best of this test, And don't ask why
Em              D             C                 G
   It's not a question, But a lesson learned in time

     Em             G            Em            G
It's something unpredictable But in the end is right
  Em               D            G
I hope you had the time of your life

   So take the photographs, And still frames in your mind
G                        C                   D
   Hang it on a shelf in good helth and good time
Em            D             C             G
   Tattoos of memories, And dead skin on trail
Em               D             C             G
   For what it's worth, It was worth all the while

     Em             G            Em            G
It's something unpredictable But in the end is right
  Em               D            G
I hope you had the time of your life
