Ziggy Stardust â€“ David Bowie

G     D     C  Em  Am
                       Oh
G     D     C  Em  Am
      Oh    yeh
G     D     C  Em  Am
G     D     C  Em  Am
  Ahh

G                      Bm
    Ziggy played guitar,    jamming good 
               C                          D
With Wierd and Gilly and the Spiders from Mars
                  G                     Em
He played it left hand, but made it too far 
            Am                       C
Became the special man,  and we were Ziggy's band

G                         Bm         
   Ziggy really sang,   screwed up eyes and 
             C                         D
screwed down hairdo like some cat from Japan
                     G                              Em
He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang
              Am                         C
He came on so loaded man, well hung and snow-white tan

Am      G               F      /E /F /E /F /E /F G
     So where were the spiders
Am              G            F          /E /F /E /F /E /F G
     while the fly tried to break our balls.
Am            G             F        /E /F /E /F /E /F G
     Just the beer light to guide us
          D
And so we bitched about his fans 
               E
and should we crush his sweet hands

G     D     C  Em  Am
G     D     C  Em  Am

G                          Bm
    Ziggy played for time, jiving us that 
        C                            D
we were voodoo    the kids was just crass
           G                     Em
He was the nazz   with God-given ass
           Am                              C
He took it all too far   but boy could he play guitar

Am         G             F      /E /F /E /F /E /F G  
    Making love with his ego
Am        G           F          /E /F /E /F /E /F G   
    Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Am         G       F      /E /F /E /F /E /F G
    Like a leper messiah
         D
When the kids had killed the man 
          E
I had to break up the band

G     D     C  Em  Am
G     D     C  Em  Am
                      Oh
G     D     C  Em  Am
yeh
G     D     C9!                     G
