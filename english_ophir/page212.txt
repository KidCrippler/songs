Grease - Frankie Valli (-1)
Lyrics and Music: Barry Gibb

Am   Am   Am   Am   F   F   

Am                             D      Am
   I saw my problems and I'll see the light
          D         Am             Em7
We got a    lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right
Dm7                C            Bb     Am
   There ain't no danger we can go too far
            D      Am              Em7
We start believin' now that we can be who we are
               F       F
Grease is the word

Am                                 D       Am
   They think our love is just a growin'  pain
               D       Am                 Em7
Why don't they   understand? It's just a cryin' shame
Dm7                C          Bb      Am
   Their lips are lyin', only real is real
             D          Am             Em7
We stop the fight right now, we got to be what we feel
              Am
Grease is the word
          (Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)

          Dm7                      [/A]  [/G]  [/E]  [/D]  [/C]
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Am
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Dm7                       F         F
Grease is the way we are feeling

Am                                 D   Am
   We take the pressure, and we throw away
         D   Am             Em7
conventionality, belongs to yesterday
Dm7             C                Bb         Am
   There is a chance that we can make it so far
            D      Am              Em7
We start believin' now that we can be who we are
              Am
Grease is the word
          (Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)

          Dm7                      [/A]  [/G]  [/E]  [/D]  [/C]
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Am
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Dm7                       F        G
Grease is the way we are feeling

Dm7                       Em7                     F
    This is a life of illusion, wrapped up in troubles
                           E                     [/A]  [/G]  [/E]  [/D]  [/C]
(troubles)  Laced in confusion (what're we doin' here?)

Am                                 D   Am
   We take the pressure, and we throw away
         D   Am             Em7
conventionality, belongs to yesterday
Dm7             C                Bb         Am
   There is a chance that we can make it so far
            D      Am              Em7
We start believin' now that we can be who we are
              Am
Grease is the word
          (Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)

          Dm7                      [/A]  [/G]  [/E]  [/D]  [/C]
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Am
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Dm7                       F        F - /G -
Grease is the way we are feeling

{Brass} Am   Am   Am   Am
{Only drums}

 Am
Grease is the word
          (Grease is the word, is the word that you heard)

          Dm7                      [/A]  [/G]  [/E]  [/D]  [/C]
It's got groove, it's got meaning
Am
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Dm7                       F        F
Grease is the way we are feeling

 Am!
