Strong - Robbie Williams (+1)

D       G       Em      A
D       E7      G       A

D
My breath smells of a thousand fags 
       G
And when I'm drunk I dance like me Dad
      Em                         A
I've started to dress a bit like him
       D
And early morning when I wake up
  G
I look like Kiss but without the make-up
       Em                                 A
And that's a good line to take it to the bridge

G                                       Bm
   And you know, and you know 'cause my life's a mess
Em                              A
   And I'm trying to grow, so before I'm old I'll confess

D                   E7            G              A
You think that I'm strong, you're wrong, you're wrong
D            E7       G        A
I'll sing my song, my song, my song

D                             G
My bed's full of takeaways, a fantasies of easy lays
    Em                         A
The pause button's broke on my video.
       D                             
And is this real? 'Cause I feel fake,
G 
Oprah Winfrey, Ricki Lake
Em                              A
Teach me things I don't need to know

G                                       Bm
   And you know, and you know 'cause my life's a mess
Em                              A
   And i'ts started to show, so before I'm old I'll confess

D                   E7            G              A
You think that I'm strong, you're wrong, you're wrong
D            E7       G        A
I'll sing my song, my song, my song

     C
If I did it all again I'd be a nun
    G
The rain was never cold when I was young
          Em                 B
I'm still young, we're still young
Am
Life's too short to be afraid
 G     Em       D       E7       G         A
Step inside the sun

take a pill to numb the pain
                      (you're wrong)
G                                  A
You don't have to take the blame
