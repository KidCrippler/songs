                               Ohhhhhhhh 

 A                          D       
flew in from Miami Beach, B.O.A.C
C                      D       
Didn't get to bed last night
A                            D       
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
C                      D
Man, I had a dreadful flight

                   A
I'm back in the USSR
C                               D        D!
   You don't know how lucky you are, boy
               A     D - Eb - E
Back in the USSR

A                            D       
Been away so long, I hardly knew the place
C                         D       
Gee, it's good to be back home
A                            D       
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
C                     D
Honey, disconnect the phone

                   A
I'm back in the USSR
C                               D        D!

Back in the USSR         well,

    D
The Ukraine girls really knock me out
     A
They leave the West behind
    D      /C#           /C       /Bb
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
     E7                  D7                     A      
That Georgia's always on my, my, my, my, my, my mind

A                                         D       
Show me around your snow-peaked mountains way down south
C                       D       
Take me to your daddy's farm
A                           D       
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
C                          D
Come and keep your comrade warm
