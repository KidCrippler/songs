Hometown Glory - Adele
Lyrics and Music: Adele Adkins

Bm      D/A      D/F#       G
Bm      D/A      D/F#       G

          Bm                     D/A
I've been walking in the same way
  D/F#       G
as I         did
Bm                            D/A
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
    D/F#                             G
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
         Bm                    D/A
Is there anything I can do for you dear?
        D/F#               G
Is there    anyone I could call?
Bm                         D/A
No one thank you, please Mad-am
    D/F#                  G!
I        ain't lost, just wandering...
 
         Bm       D/A
Round my hometown
    D/F#         G
Me---mories are fresh
         Bm        D/A
Round my hometown
       D/F#         G
Ooh the people I've met
        Bm         D/A
Are the wonders of m--y world
        D/F#        G
Are the wonders of m--y world
        Bm         D/A
Are the wonders of this world
        D/F#      G
Are the wonders now
 
  Bm                  D/A
I like it in the city when
          D/F#             G
the air is so thick   and opaque
  Bm                D/A
I love to see everybody
        D/F#                G
in short skirts, shorts and shades
  Bm                 D/A
I like it in the city when
    D/F#      G
two worlds collide
            Bm                 D/A
You get the people and the government
         D/F#              G
Everybody taking different sides
 
Bm                        D/A
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
                  D/F#
Shows that we are united
                          G
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Bm                        D/A
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
                  D/F#      G
Shows that we are united

         Bm       D/A
Round my hometown
    D/F#         G
Me---mories are fresh
         Bm        D/A
Round my hometown
