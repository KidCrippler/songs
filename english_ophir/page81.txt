Dm                  F          Bb          C
   You drink your coffee, and     I sip my tea    And we're
Dm                  F                         Bb                      A
   sitting here,   playing so cool, Thinking,      What will be, will be
F                           C          
   And it's getting kind of late now
Dm                                  A
   Oh, I wonder if you'll stay now, Stay now, stay now, stay now
   Dm       F      G      /B          Dm        A     A  
Or will you just politely     say Goodnight?

Dm                   F             Bb              C
    I move a little closer to you,    Not knowing quite what to do and I'm
Dm              F                                 Bb               A
    Feeling all fingers and thumbs,    I spill my tea,    oh silly me
F                            C
    But it's getting kind of late now
Dm                               A
    I wonder if you'll stay now, Stay now, stay now, stay now
   Dm       F      G      /B           Dm        A
Or will you just politely     say Goodnight?

            F                  C
And then we touch,    much too much
     Dm                            A
This moment has been waiting for a long, long time,
         F                          C
Makes me shiver,         Makes me quiver
     Dm                             C
This moment I am so unsure,    This moment I have waited for
           Bb                                                A        A
Well is it something you've been waiting for,    Waiting for too?

Dm                   F                  Bb                   C 
Take off your eyes,  Bare your soul,    Gather me to you and make me whole,
Dm                     F                  Bb                   A
Tell me your secrets,  Sing me the song,  Sing it to me in the silent tongue.
F                            C
    But it's getting kind of late now
Dm                               A
    I wonder if you'll stay now, Stay now, stay now, stay now
   Dm       F      G      /B           Dm        A
Or will you just politely     say Goodnight?
