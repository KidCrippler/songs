Empty spaces, what are we living for
            G
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
Em              F#sus4       F#            Em
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for
        Bm
Another hero, another mindless crime
             G
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Em                  F#sus4          F#          Em
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?

Another heartache, another failed romance

I guess I'm learning I must be warmer now
             A
I'll soon be turning round the corner now
  F#m
Outside the dawn is breaking
    G#sus4        G#                    F#m      Em!
but inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
