Let It Go - Frozen (+1)

Em    C    D     Am
Em    C    D     A
 
    Em                      C
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
      D               Asus4   Am
Not a footprint to be seen
  Em            C
A kingdom of isolation
       D                  Asus4    A
And it looks like I'm the queen
Em              C                 D                 Asus4  Am
    The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Em                   D                    A
    Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried

D                                 C
Don't let them in, don't let them see
                                    D
Be the good girl you always have to be
                                    C     C
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
      C               C
Well, now they know

       G          D/F#
Let it go, let it go
      Em              C
Can't hold it back anymore
       G          D/F#
Let it go, let it go 
      Em                C
Turn away and slam the door
G       D/F#              Em          C
I don't care what they're going to say
        Bm7         Bb
Let the storm rage on
    C
The cold never bothered me anyway

G   D/F#

   Em                    C              D               Am
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
        Em              D                   Asus4         A
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all

D                              C
   It's time to see what I can do
                               D  
To test the limits and break through
                                 C
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
     C       C
I'm free

       G          D/F#
Let it go, let it go
     Em                     C
I am one with the wind and sky
       G          D/F#
Let it go, let it go
       Em            C
You'll never see me cry
G      D/F#      Em         C
Here I stand and here I'll stay
         Bm        Bb      C
Let the storm rage on

C
My power flurries through the air into the ground
C
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
D
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Em        C               D              Am      C
I'm never going back, the past is in the past

       G          D/F#
Let it go, let it go
         Em                     C
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
       G          D/F#
Let it go, let it go
     Em              C
That perfect girl is gone
G      D/F#         Em       C      Cm
Here I stand in the light of day
        Bm         Bb      Bb
Let the storm rage on
    C
The cold never bothered me anyway
