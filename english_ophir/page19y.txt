            G      D/F#             C/E            Am7
The road is long        with many a winding turn
     D     /D#   Em        F                Am7     C/D  D
That leads us to who knows where, who knows where
        G        D/F#                   Em    Eb
But I'm strong,        strong enough to carry him
G                   Am7   C/D               G        Am7 
    He ain't heavy,                he's my brother

   C/D   G    D/F#                   C/E          Am7
So on we go,          his welfare is my concern
   D  /D#    Em     F               Am7     C/D  D
No burden is he, to bear, we'll get there,   
        G     D/F#                  Em     Eb 
For I know,          he would not encumber me, 
G                  Am7   C/D            G       Am7    D/B
   he ain't heavy,             He's my brother

       C            D/C           C              D/C
If I'm laden     at all, then I'm laden     with sadness
     Bm         Dm            C  B             Em      Em/D
That everyone's heart,  Isn't filled, with the gladness
   C      C/B     Am7              C/D           D
of love,                  For one another

                 G     D/F#                     C/E        Am7
It's a long long road,      from which there is no return
D       /D#        Em        F                 Am7    C/D    D
While we're on our way,   to there,    why not share
        G      Bm    G    G/D    G     G/D   Em          Eb
And the load,        do–––esn't  weigh me    down,    at all
G                  Am7   C/D            G
   he ain't heavy,             He's my brother
