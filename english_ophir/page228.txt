Dont Look Back In Anger - Oasis

C          F          C          F

C               G           Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind
          E7             F
Don't you know you might find
G                     C     Am  G
   A better place to play
C               G           Am
You said   that you'd never been
            E7                 F
But all the things that you've seen
G                C     Am  G
    Slowly fade away

F                  Fm
  So I start a revolution 
        C       C
from my bed
         F                 Fm
'Cos you said the brains I had
           C       C
went to my head
F             Fm
Step outside, summertime's 
    C        C
in bloom
G
Stand up beside the fireplace
E7/G#
Take that look from off your face
Am             G
You ain't ever gonna burn
   F           F     G     G    G    G
my heart out

    C     G         Am
And so    Sally can wait
    E7             F
she knows it's too late
         G          C     Am  G
as we're walking on by
    C       G      Am     E7
Her soul   slides away
               F              G
but don't look back in anger
            C   
I heard you say
(C)    G    Am    E7    F    G    C    Am  G

C              G               Am
Take me to the place where you go
      E7      F
Where nobody knows, 
G                     C      Am  G
     if it's night or day
C                     G           Am
Please don't put your life in the hands
     E7            F
of a rock and roll band
G                       C    Am  G
    who'll throw it all away

F                       Fm
  I'm gonna start a revolution
