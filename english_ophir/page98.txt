                 G                    Em
Every breath you take, Every move you make
                C                    D   
Every bond you break, every step you take
                      Em   Em
I'll be watching you

             G                   Em
Every single day, Every word you say
               C                      D  
Every game you play, every night you stay
                       G   G
I'll be watching you

              C   C/A#                G
Oh, can't you see       You belong to me
                  A7                         D
How my poor heart aches, With every step you take

               G                    Em
Every move you make, Every vow you break
                C                      D  
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
                     Em   Em
I'll be watching you 

Eb
   Since you've gone!   I've been lost!  without a trace
F
   I dream at night, I can only   see your face
Eb
   I look around,   but it's you I can't replace
F
   I feel so cold,    and I long for your embrace
Eb                              G
   I keep!   crying baby, baby please,
