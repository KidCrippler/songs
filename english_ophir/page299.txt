I was born in a cross-fire hurricane
      B            A                 B         A
And I howled at my Ma in the driving rain
         D   A     E                   B
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
         D   A          E                         B
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash it's a gas, gas, gas.

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
      B               A                     B         A
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
         D   A     E                   B
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
         D   A          E                         B
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash it's a gas, gas, gas

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
       B          A                    B         A
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
   B              A                    B       A
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread    Yeah, yeah, yeah
      B              A                      B         A
I was crowned with a spike right through my head
         D   A     E                   B
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
         D   A          E                         B              B!  B!  B!
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash it's a gas, gas, gas

B                   E      A
Jumping Jack Flash, it's a gas
B                   E      A
Jumping Jack Flash, it's a gas
B                   E      A
Jumping Jack Flash, it's a gas
B                   E      A
Jumping Jack Flash, it's a gas
B                   E      A
Jumping Jack Flash, it's a gas
B                   E      A
Jumping Jack Flash, it's a gas
