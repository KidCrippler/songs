We starve, look at one another, short of breath
                              A
Walking proudly in our winter coats
 
Wearing smells from laboratories
Bm             D
Facing a dying nation 
   Bm           F#7
of moving paper fantasy
F#7                        Bm
Listening for the new told lies
        G               D
With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Bm                                     Bm
Somewhere, inside something there is a rush of
                                     A
Greatness, who knows what stands in front    of
                        Bm          D
Our lives, I fashion my future   on films in space
Bm               F#
Silence tells me secretly
F#             Bm         G                D

Across the Atlantic Sea

And I'm a genius, genius
    F#
I believe in God
        F#
And I believe that God believes in Claude
       F#                    Bm
That's me, that's me, that's me

We starve, look at one another, short of breath

Singing our space songs on a spider web sitar
                       A
Life is around you and in you
