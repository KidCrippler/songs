{Guitar rif    X4}

F    F    Dm!
                    A 
We passed upon the stairs
                    Dm
We spoke of was and when
                  A 
Although I wasn´t there
                  F
He said I was his friend
                    C
Which came as some surprise
                 A 
I spoke into his eyes
                    Dm
I thought you died alone
                   C   C
A long, long time ago
    C          F
Who knows, not me
   C#            F
I never lost control
       C       F
You're face to face
         C#                    A   A  Dm  Dm
With the man who sold the world

F    F    Dm!

                        A 
I laughed and shook his hand
                  Dm
Made my way back home
                        A 
I searched for form and land
                              F
For years and years, I roamed
                  C
I gazed a gazley stare
                    A 
At all the millions here
                  Dm
I must have died alone
                   C   C
A long, long time ago
    C          F
Who knows, not me
   C#            F
I never lost control
       C       F
You're face to face
         C#               A   A  Dm  Dm
With the man who sold the world
    C          F
Who knows, not me
   C#            F
I never lost control
       C       F
You're face to face
         C#                    A   A  Dm  Dm
With the man who sold the world
