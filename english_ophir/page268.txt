The Boxer - Simon and Garfunkel

I am just a poor boy
                  B/Bb   Abm
though my story's seldom told
       F#
I have squandered my resistance
      F#           F#
For a pocketful of mumbles 
          B        B
such are promises
B     B/Bb     Abm
  All lies and jest still a 
F#                E
man hears what he wants to hear
    E              B
And disregards the rest
  F#   F#   F#      B
mmm   mmm   mmm   mmm
  B  B   B    
mmmmmmmmmmmm
 
       B
When I left my home and family 
      B       B/Bb  Abm
I was no more than a boy
       F#
In the company of strangers
       F#         F#
In the quiet of a railway station 
B                B
running scared
B  B/Bb   Abm
   Laying low 
        F#             E
seeking out the poorer quarters 
          E             B
where the ragged people go
        F#             E
Looking for the places only 
           B
they would know

       Abm

       B
Asking only workmans wages 
       B       B/Bb  Abm
I come looking for a job
             F#
But I get no offers
       F#               F#
Just a come-on from the whores
           B        B
on Seventh Avenue
B   B/Bb  Abm
  I do declare 
           F#               E
there were times when I was so lonesome 
  E                 B
I took some comfort there
      F#          F#    F#
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes 
    B      B/Bb   Abm
and wishing I was gone
      F#       F#
Going home 
          F#            F#
where the New York City winters aren't 
B            B
bleeding me
Ebm      Ebm    Abm    Abm
 Leading me-----e
      F#7     F#7   F#7
Going home
B    B    B    B
 
       B
In the clearing stands a boxer 
      B      B/Bb    Abm
and a fighter by his trade
       F#            F#
And he carries the reminders
   F#               F#
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down 
   B               B
or cut him till he cried out
       B     B/Bb    Abm
In his anger and his shame
      F#            E
"I am leaving, I am leaving." 
        E               B
but the fighter still remains
 F#   E    B    B
