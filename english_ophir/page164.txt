Two jumps in a week I bet you 
Asus2                                E    Esus4   E
think that's pretty clever don't you boy
F#m  
Flying on your motorcycle
Asus2                               E     Esus4  E   
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
      F#m  
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Asus2                       E     Esus4   E
Kill yourself to never ever stop
    F#m  
You broke another mirror
       Asus2                          E   Esus4  E
You're turning into something you are not

               F#m    Asus2
Don't leave me high 
                E       E
Don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation
Asus2                          E    Esus4  E
You will be the one who cannot talk
F#m  
All your insides fall to pieces
Asus2                                E              Esus4  E  
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
F#m  
They're the ones who'll hate you When you
Asus2                                 E        Esus4  E
think you've got the world all sussed out
F#m  
They're the ones who'll spit at you
Asus2                 E       Esus4  E
You will be the one screaming out

               F#m    Asus2
Don't leave me high 
                E       E
Don't leave me dry
               F#m    Asus2
Don't leave me high 
                E       E
Don't leave me dry
