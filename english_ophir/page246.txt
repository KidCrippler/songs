Rocket Man - Elton John

Gm7                                C9
     She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Gm7                     C9
     Zero hour, nine a.m.
Eb                    Bb/D           Cm  Cm/Bb
     And I'm gonna be hi-------------gh
             F/A
as a kite by then
Gm7                              C9
     I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
Gm7                               C9
           It's so lonely out in space
Eb             Bb/D      Cm          Cm/Bb  F/A  F7
     On such a ti---------meless flight

Bb                                         Eb
    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
                                          Bb
'Till touch down brings me round again to find
                                   Eb
I'm not the man they think I am at home
           Bb/D                C9
Oh no, no, no,           I'm a rocket man
Eb                                  Bb           Eb 
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
Bb                                         Eb
    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
                                          Bb
'Till touch down brings me round again to find
                                   Eb
I'm not the man they think I am at home
           Bb/D                C9
Oh no, no, no,           I'm a rocket man
Eb                                  Bb            Eb
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone

Gm7                                  C9
     Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
Gm7                                     C9
                   In fact it's cold as hell
Eb                     Bb/D     Cm          Cm/Bb
    And there's no one there to raise them
            F/A   F/A   F/A   F/A
     if you did
Gm7                               C9
     And all this science I don't understand
Gm7                                C9
     It's just my job, five days a week
         Eb   Bb/D  Cm  Cm/Bb
A rocket m----------an
         F/A     F/A    F7     F7
a rocket man
