You're The One That I Want - Grease Soundtrack
Lyrics and Music: John Farrar

Am   Am   Am    Am 

       Am
I got chills, they're multiplyin'
         F          C
and I'm losin' control
            E               Am
'Cause the power you're supplyin'
            Am     Am    Am    Am
it's electrifyin'
 
                 C            Em
You better shape up, 'cause I need a man
Am                          F
     and my heart is set on you
                 C              Em
You better shape up, you better understand
Am                           F
      to my heart I must be true
         F
Nothing left, nothing left for me to do

           C
You're the one that I want 
                                F
you are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey
    C
The one that I want 
                                F
you are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey
    C
The one that I want 
                                F
you are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh
           G
The one I need (the one I need)
         G7
oh yes indeed (yes indeed)

Am    Am

          Am
If you're filled with affection
             F        C
you're too shy to convey
     E        Am
Meditate my direction
Am                Am
feel your way

               C              Em
I better shape up, 'cause you need a man (I need a man)
Am                       F
   Who can keep me satisfied
               C          Em
I better shape up, if I'm gonna prove (You better prove)
Am                        F
   That my faith is justified
         F
Are you sure? Yes I'm sure down deep inside

           C
You're the one that I want 
                                F
you are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey
    C
The one that I want 
                                F
you are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey
    C
The one that I want 
                                F
you are the one I want, ooh ooh ooh
           G
The one I need (the one I need)
         G7
oh yes indeed (yes indeed)
