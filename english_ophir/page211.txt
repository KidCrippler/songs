Am      Am 

      Am                    Am
I got chills, they're multiplyin'
        F          C
and I'm losin' control
           E                Am
'Cause the power you're supplyin'

                 C              Em
You better shape up, you better understand
Am                           F
      to my heart I must be true
        F             F
Nothing left, nothing left for me to do

           C                F

Am    Am

Am
If you're filled with affection
           F             C
you're too shy     to convey
    E              Am
Meditate      my direction
Am                Am
feel your way

               C              Em
I better shape up, 'cause you need a man
              Am                        F
I need a man       who can keep me satisfied
               C          Em
I better shape up, if I'm gonna prove
                  Am                        F
You better prove      that my faith is justified
        F              F
Are you sure?  Yes I'm sure down deep inside

           C                F
