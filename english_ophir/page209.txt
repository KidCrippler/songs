   When I first met you I was cold
G7                         Am7
   A melting snowman I was told
G7                               F6
   But there was no one there to hold
  F
Before I swore
     G7                       C
that I would be alone forever more

'Cause to stand up   out in the crowd

   There is no reason to feel bad
    G7
But there are many seasons to feel
Am7
glad, sad, mad
     G7                                  F6
It´s just a bunch of feelings that we've had
   F                   G7
To hope    that I   am here 
                     C
to help you with the load

time, time, time
G7                                     F6
