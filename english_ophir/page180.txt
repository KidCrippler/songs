There's a fire starting in my heart,
Bb                                  Gm                 Bb
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Cm             Gm
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Bb                            Gm                 Bb
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your shit bare
 
Cm                      Gm
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Bb                      Gm                   Bb
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
Cm                Gm
There's a fire starting in my heart
Bb                               Gm                       Bb
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
 
Ab              Bb                   Gm
   The scars of your love, remind me of us
             Ab                          Bb Ab
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
             Bb                       Gm
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
             G7
I can't help feeling...

               Ab                          Ab             Bb

Baby, I have no story to be told,
    Bb                             Gm                   Bb
But I've heard one on you. Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Cm                 Gm
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Bb                         Gm                        Bb
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
 
Ab              Bb                   Gm
   The scars of your love, remind me of us. 
(You're gonna wish you, never had met me)

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa)
 
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.
