Get your motor runnin'      Head out on the highway
Lookin' for adventure       In whatever comes our way

G        A             E
   Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
G           A          E
   Take the world in a love embrace
G       A          E                      
   Fire all of the guns at once and
G     A          E
   Explode into space

E
I like smoke and lightnin'       Heavy metal thunder
Wrestlin' with the wind          And the feelin' that I'm under

G        A             E
   Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
G           A          E
   Take the world in a love embrace

   Fire all of the guns at once and
G     A          E
   Explode into space

        E
Like a true nature's child
        G     
We were born, born to be wild
          A              G                  E!
We could climb so high,       I never wanna die
E!         D!     E!   D!   E!         D!         E!    D!
Born to be wild,            Born to be wild,
