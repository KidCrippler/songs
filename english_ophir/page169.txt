G!                         C              G
     I need love, love, to ease my mind
          Bm    Em                   C
I need to find time, someone to call mine
    D
But mama said:
  
    G                         C            G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
          Bm              Em   
She said, love don't come easy
C              D
it's a game of give and take
    G                         C            G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
      Bm          Em                         
Just trust on the good times
   C          D
no matter how long it takes
 
    Bm
But how many heartaches must I stand
         Em 
before I find a love to let me live again
              Am/C 
Right now the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
       D                 D6            D7
when I feel my strength,    ohhhu it's almost gone
    D
I remember, (mama said):
 
    G                         C            G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
          Bm              Em  
She said, love don't come easy
C              D
it's a game of give and take
    G                          C           G
How long must I wait, how much more must I take
       Bm       Em        C
before lo---neliness will cause my heart
D
heart to break?
 
    Bm
No, I can't bear to live my life alone
         Em
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
           Am/C
But when I feel that I,    I can't go on
       D             D6         D7
these precious words    keep me hanging on
    D
I remember, (mama said):
 
    G                         C            G 
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
          Bm              Em   
She said, love don't come easy
     C              D
well it's a game of give and take
    G                         C            G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
          Bm          Em                    
you just trust in the good times
   C            D               G!      
no matter how   long it takes, Break!

No, love, love, don't come easy
[Guitar joins]
      Bm      Em         C    D
but I keep on waiting, anticipating 
         G                      C     G
for that soft voice, to talk to me at night
         Bm     Em         C       D
for some tender arms,   to hold me tight
[Others join]
       G               C        G
I keep waiting,      untill I fade
             Bm    Em            C         D
But it ain't easy,      it ain't easy. But mama said
 
    G                         C            G 
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
          Bm              Em   
She said, love don't come easy
     C              D
well it's a game of give and take
    G                         C            G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
          Bm              Em   
She said, love don't come easy
C              D                  G!      
it's a game of give and take, now Break!
