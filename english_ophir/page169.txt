G!                            C              G
     I need love, love, oh to ease my mind
              Bm    Em                   C
And I need to find time, someone to call mine
    D
But mama said:

    G                         C            G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
          Bm              Em   
She said, love don't come easy
C              D
it's a game of give and take
    G                         C            G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
      Bm        Em                         
Just trust in a good time
    C          D
no matter how long it takes
 
Bm
How many heartaches must I stand
         Em 
before I find a love to let me live again
              Am/C 
Right now the only thing that keeps me hangin' on
       D                 D6            D7
when I feel my strength,    ohhhu it's almost gone
    D
I remember, (mama said):
 
    G                         C            G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
          Bm              Em  
She said, love don't come easy
C              D
it's a game of give and take
     G                          C           G
How long must I wait, how much more must I take
       Bm       Em         C
before lo---neliness will cause my heart
D
heart to break?
 
    Bm
No, I can't bear to live my life alone
         Em
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
           Am/C
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
             D             D6         D7
Well, these precious words    keep me hanging on
    D
I remember, mama said:
 
    G                         C            G 
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
          Bm              Em   
She said, love don't come easy
     C               D
well it's a game of give and take
     G                         C            G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
          Bm         Em                    
you just trust in a good time
    C          D                   G!      
no matter how long it takes, now Break!

    G                      C G
No, love, love, don't come easy
{Guitar joins}
      Bm      Em         C    D
but I keep on waiting, anticipating 
         G                      C     G
for that soft voice, to talk to me at night
         Bm     Em          C       D
for some tender arms,   to hold me tight
{Others join}
        G              C        G
I keep waiting, (ooh) til that day
             Bm    Em                      C
But it ain't easy,      you know it ain't easy
     D
But mama said
 
    G                         C            G 
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
          Bm              Em   
She said, love don't come easy
     C              D
well it's a game of give and take
     G                         C            G
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
          Bm              Em   
She said, love don't come easy
C              D                   G!      
it's a game of give and take, now Break!
