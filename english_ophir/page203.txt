If you, if you could return
           A                    A
Don't let it burn, don't let it fade
                       C
I'm sure I'm not being rude
                       C
But it's just your attitude
                 G
It's tearing me apart
                  G
It's ruining everything
       D                         D
And I swore, I swore I would be true
                 A
And honey so did you
   A                         C
So why were you holding her hand
                    C
Is that the way we stand
                       G
Were you lying all the time
                      G
Was it just a game to you

              D     D
But I'm in so deep
                    A            A
You know I'm such a fool for you
                               C       C
You got me wrapped around your finger
                      G
Do you have to let it linger
 
Do you have to, do you have to
                      D
do you have to let it linger

D       A                    A
Oh,   I thought the world of you
          C                 C
I thought nothing could go wrong
           G              G
But I was wrong    I was wrong
   D                     D
If you, if you could get by
              A
Trying not to lie
 A                       C
Things wouldn't be so confused
                       C 
And I wouldn't feel so used
                      G
But you always really knew
                     G 
I just wanna be with you

You know I'm such a fool for you
                               C       C
You got me wrapped around your finger
                      G
Do you have to let it linger
 
Do you have to, do you have to
                      D
do you have to let it linger

do you have to let it linger
