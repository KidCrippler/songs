          Am         E+
There’s a lady who’s sure
    C                D
All that glitters is gold
          Fmaj                 G  Am
And she’s buying a stairway to heaven.
         Am             E+
When she gets there she knows
        C              D
If the stores are all closed
       Fmaj                      G    Am
With a word she can get what she came for.
C    D    F    Am      
Ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh 
          C         G              D
and she’s buying a stairway to heaven.

          C          D
There’s a sign on the wall
        Fmaj        Am
But she wants to be sure
          C              D              Fmaj
cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
     Am          E+ *
In a tree by the brook
          C            D
There’s a songbird who sings,
          Fmaj                       G  Am
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

G  Am7     D                  Am7       Em/D D C/D D 
           oooooo it makes me wonder...
Am7      D                 Am7     Em/D D C/D D 
oooooooooo     it makes me wonder...

          C         G
There’s a feeling I get
       Am
When I look to the west,
       C         G          F   Am
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
      C               G
In my thoughts I have seen
         Am
Rings of smoke through the trees,
        C         G               F   Am 
And the voices of those who stand looking.

C    G   Am7        D                       Am7       Em/D D C/D D 
               oooooo it makes me wonder...
Am7      D                               Am7     Em/D D C/D D 
oooooooooo  it really makes me wonder...

        C              G
And its whispered that soon
      Am          
If we all call the tune
         C          G          F   Am
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
      C            G
And a new day will dawn
    Am
For those who stand long
        C            G         F    Am
And the forests will echo with laughter.

C    G   Am7        D                       Am7       Em/D D C/D D 

Am7      D                               Am7     Em/D D C/D D 
      oooooooooo  

C               G              Am
   If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow Don’t be alarmed now,
C              G                    F    Am
   It’s just a spring clean for the may queen.
C              G                 Am
   Yes, there are two paths you can go by, But in the long run
C                G                  F           Am
   There’s still time to change the road you’re on.

C    G   Am7        D                         Am7       Em/D D C/D D 
                       and it makes me wonder...
Am7        D                       Am7       Em/D D C/D D 
          ooohhho 

C               G              Am
   Your head is humming and it won’t go, In case you don’t know,
C             G              F    Am
   The pipers calling you to join him,
C             G                Am
   Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, And did you know
C                G           F          Am
   Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

Am   G    F    F    X6
Am   G    F    F    X4

Am           G                F
   And as we wind on down the road
Am             G               F
   Our shadows taller than our soul.
Am               G           F
   There walks a lady we all know
Am                  G                  F
   Who shines white light and wants to show
Am          G                    F
   How everything still turns to gold.
Am            G           F
   And if you listen very hard
Am               G              F
   The tune will come to you at last.
Am              G              F
   When all are one and one is all
Am         G               F
   To be a rock and not to roll.

Am           G                F        X4

And she’s buying a stairway to heaven.
