Dm    F     Bb/F     A/E

Dm                                                         F
    I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
                                             Bb/F
There was something so pleasant about that place
                                           A/E
Even your emotions had an echo In so much space
Dm                                                             F
    And when you're out there Without care, Yeah, I was out of touch
                                     Bb/F                     A/E    A/E!
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough    I just knew too much

                   Dm                          F
Does that make me crazy?    Does that make me crazy?    
                   Bb/F               A/E
Does that make me crazy?        Probably

Dm                                                                        F
    Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are
                    Bb/F                                              A/E
Ha ha ha bless your soul               You really think you're in control

                     Dm                               F
Well, I think you're crazy            I think you're crazy
                Bb/F                            A/E
I think you're crazy                  Just like me

{Rhythm change}
D                                                    F
     And I hope that you are having the time of your life
           Bb                     A
But think twice, that's my only advice

Dm                                                                  F
    Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
                             Bb                               A
But it's no coincidence I've come      And I can die when I'm done

           Dm                       F                       Bb               A    /B   /C#
Maybe I'm crazy       Maybe you're crazy       Maybe we're crazy       Probably
           Em                       G                       C                B      Em
Maybe I'm crazy       Maybe you're crazy       Maybe we're crazy       Probably
