Roar - Katy Perry
 
A       A       A       A

A
   I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
A                     Bm
   Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
F#m                                 D
    So I sit quietly,       agree politely
A 
    I guess that I forgot I had a choice
A                    Bm
   I let you push me past the breaking point
F#m                                      D
   I stood for nothing,    so I fell for everything

    A                 A          A
You held me down, but I got up
                 Bm
Already brushing off the dust
    F#m                 F#m             F#m
You hear my voice,  you hear that sound
                    D
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
    A                 A           A
You held me down, but I got up
                     Bm
Get ready cause I've had enough
  F#m            F#m          F#m
I see it all,  I see it now

          D          A
I got the eye of the tiger, the fighter
                     Bm
Dancing through the fire
      F#m
Cause I am a champion 
                 D       A
and you're gonna hear me roar louder
                Bm
louder than a lion
      F#m
Cause I am a champion
                 D        A
and you're gonna hear me ro------a-a-a-a-a-o
           Bm       F#m
o------a-a-a-a-a-o       o------a-a-a-a-a-o
             D       A     A!
You're gonna hear me roar

A
   Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly
A                  Bm
   Stingin' like a bee I earned my stripes
F#m                                 D
   I went from zero,      to my own hero

    A                 A          A
You held me down, but I got up
                 Bm
Already brushing off the dust
    F#m                 F#m             F#m
You hear my voice,  you hear that sound
                    D
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
    A                 A           A
You held me down, but I got up
                     Bm
Get ready cause I've had enough
  F#m            F#m          F#m
I see it all,  I see it now

          D          A
I got the eye of the tiger, the fighter
                     Bm
Dancing through the fire
      F#m
Cause I am a champion 
                 D       A
and you're gonna hear me roar louder
               Bm

You're gonna hear me ro------a-a-a-a-a-o
           Bm       F#m
o------a-a-a-a-a-o       o------a-a-a-a-a-o
             D       A   {Turn quiet}
You're gonna hear me roar

       Bm       F#m            E

     E      E       E     E! E! E! E! E! E! E! E!
Roar   roar   roar   roar  roar
