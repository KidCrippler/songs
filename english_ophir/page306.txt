Lyrics and Music: Lennonâ€“McCartney

G   Bm   Em   Em7   C   C 

G           Bm             Em    Em7
 I read the news today, oh boy
C        C/B           Asus2
 About a lucky man who made the grade
G               Bm              Em   Em7
 And though the news was rather sad
C             F          Em   Em7
 Well, I just had to laugh
C          F       Em   C
 I saw the photograph

G            Bm            Em   Em7
 He blew his mind out in a car
C          C/B             Asus2
 He didn't notice that the lights had changed
G           Bm               Em      Em7
 A crowd of people stood and stared
C                F
 They'd seen his face before
Em
Nobody was really sure
   Em7                      C
If he was from the House of Lords

G        Bm             Em   Em7
 I saw a film today, oh boy
C            C/B           Asus2
 The English Army had just won the war
G           Bm            Em   Em7
 A crowd of people turned away
C           F
 But I just had to look
Em      Em7      C
 Having read the book
            Em/F#   /G     /A   /B  /C#  /D
I'd love to turn    you    on

     E
Woke up, fell out of bed
                         Dsus2
Dragged a comb across my head
         E                  B7sus4
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
    E            B7sus4
And looking up I noticed I was late
         E
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
                        Dsus2
Made the bus in seconds flat
         E                B7sus4
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
E                    B7sus4
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream.

C     G     D      A      E
Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
C     G      D     A      E
(E)   D - C   D -

G          Bm            Em  Em7
I read the news today oh boy
C             C/B                 Asus2
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
G              Bm                Em    Em7
And though the holes were rather small
C           F
They had to count them all
Em
Now they know how many holes it
Em7                      C
takes to fill the Albert Hall
            Em/F#   /G     /A   /B  /C#  /D
I'd love to turn    you    on

E
