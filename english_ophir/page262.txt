{Guitar}
F       C       Am       G     x2
{drums}
F       C       Am       G     x2

        F      C     Am    G
Well I started out
       F     C       Am    G
Down a dirty road
F       C            Am    G
Started out
F    C               Am    G
All alone
        F        C    Am    G
And the sun went down
     F           C    Am    G
as I crossed the hill
        F        C    Am    G
And the town lit up
    F         C       Am    G
the world got still

    F           C     Am    G
I'm learning to fly
      F         C     Am    G
but I ain't got wings
F      C              Am    G
coming down
       F       C      Am    G
is the hardest thing

          F        C   Am    G
Well the "Good old days"
    F     C           Am     G
May not return
        F           C    Am   G
And the rocks might melt
        F         C     Am    G
and the sea may burn

    F            C    Am    G
I'm learning to fly
      F         C     Am    G
but I ain't got wings
F      C              Am    G
coming down
       F       C      Am    G
is the hardest thing

{Only guitar}
     F        C      Am    G
Well some say life
     F        C      Am    G
will beat you down
F          C         Am    G
Break your heart
 F          C        Am    G
steal your crown

{Everyone returns}

    F       C       Am     G
So start it out
    F         C     Am     G
for God knows where
  F          C      Am     G
I guess I'll know
     F     C        Am     G
when I get there

    F            C    Am    G
I'm learning to fly
 F          C         Am    G
Around the clouds
    F         C       Am    G
But what goes up
F         C           Am    G
Must come down

{Rhythm back}
    F            C    Am    G
I'm learning to fly
      F         C     Am    G
but I ain't got wings
F      C              Am    G
coming down
       F       C      Am    G
is the hardest thing
    F            C    Am    G
I'm learning to fly
 F          C         Am    G
Around the clouds
    F         C       Am    G
But what goes up
F         C           Am    G
Must come down

    F            C    Am           G
I'm learning to fly  (learning to fly)
 F          C         Am    G
