Jeremy - Pearl Jam
Lyrics: Eddie Vedder Music: Jeff Ament

A    G     A     G
{Drums}
A    G     A     G

A            G
     At home
 
Drawing pictures
            G
Of mountain tops
A
With him on top
          A
Lemon yellow sun
G
Arms raised in a V
G            A
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below
 
A   G                    G
      Daddy didn't give attention
A   G
      Oh, to the fact that 
             A     G
mommy didn't care
                A      G 
King Jeremy The Wicked
A
Ruled his world

F            Dm  E      A
Jeremy spoke in class today
F            Dm  E      A
Jeremy spoke in class today

A   G
      Clearly I remember
               G    A
Pickin' on the boy
 
Seemed a harmless little fuck
A   G
      But we unleashed a lion
A           G
Gnashed his teeth
 
And bit the recess lady's breast
               A     G
How could I forget
                                   G
And he hit me with a surprise left
A
My jaw left hurting
                 A
Dropped wide open
G
  Just like the day
    A
Oh, like the day I heard

A   G                     G         A 
       Daddy didn't give affection, no!

And the boy was something 
                    A     G
that mommy wouldn't wear
                 A
King Jeremy The Wicked
A
Ruled his world

F            Dm  E      A
Jeremy spoke in class today
F            Dm  E      A
Jeremy spoke in class today
F            Dm  E      A
Jeremy spoke in class today
F            Dm  E      A
Jeremy spoke in class today

F     G     A      A

              A
Try to forget this
              A
Try to forget this
             A
Try to erase this
             A
Try to erase this 
                   F    Dm    Am    Am
from the black board

F            Dm  E      A
Jeremy spoke in class today
F            Dm  E      A
Jeremy spoke in class today
F              Dm
Jeremy spoke in   spoke in 
A               A
Jeremy spoke in   spoke in 
F            Dm  E      A
Jeremy spoke in class today
