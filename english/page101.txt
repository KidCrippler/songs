Em    C    Am    G  G/F#
Em    C    Am    G  G/F#

    Em            C                     Am
I'm sorry for the times that I made you scream
        G           G/F#         Em
For the times that I killed your dreams
        C                      Am             G     G/F#
For the times that I made your whole world rumble

    Em            C                     Am
          For the times that I made you cry
        G           G/F#     Em
For the times that I told you lies
        C                       Fmaj7
For the times that I watched and let you stumble    {[drums]}

        Em    C             Am    
It's too bad,     but that's me
G       G/F#  Em           C             Am
   What goes around comes around, you'll see
G       G/F#   Am     D      G        Em
    That I can carry     the burden of pain
                   Am           D        G         Em
'Cause it ain't the first time    that a man goes insane
                    Am        D        G            Em
And when I spread my wings       to embrace him for life
                  Am            D        G        C
I suck out all the love I, I'll never be nobody's wife

Em    C    Am    G  G/F#
Em    C    Am    G  G/F#

    Em            C                        Am
I'm sorry for the times that I didn't come home
         G           G/F#   Em
Left you lyin' in that bed alone
       C                        Am             G     G/F#
Flyin' high in the sky when you needed my shoulder 
    Em                  C                     Am
         You're like a stone hangin' round my neck, see
       G              G/F#      Em
Cut it loose before it breaks my back, see
           C                     Am         G     G/F#
I've gotta say what I feel before I grow older
    Em          C                     Am
I'm sorry but I ain't gonna change my ways
              G            G/F#      Em
You know I've tried but I'm still the same
     C           Fmaj7
I've got to do it my own way


        Em    C             Am    
It's too bad,     but that's me
G       G/F#  Em           C             Am
   What goes around comes around, you'll see

    That I can carry     the burden of pain
