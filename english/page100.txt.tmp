The sound of silence – Simon and Garfunkel

Dm
                        C
Hello darkness, my old friend,
                            Dm
I've come to talk with you again,
                      Bb    F          
Because a vision softly creeping,
                        Bb     F 
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
        Bb                       
And the vision that was planted 
      F                      Dm     F
in my brain, Still remains
           C           Dm        Dm! 
Within the sound    of silence


                             C         
In restless dreams I walked alone
                         Dm
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
                   Bb       F
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
                          Bb       F
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        Bb             
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash 
          F                           Dm   F
of a neon light, That split the night
                C        Dm
And touched the sound of silence.

                         C
And in the naked light I saw
                           Dm
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
                   Bb      F
People talking without speaking,
                  Bb        F
People hearing without listening,
               Bb              
People writing songs that voices 
      F                       Dm   F
never share, And no one dare
            C        Dm
Disturb the sound of silence.

                          C
Fools said I, you do not know
                       Dm
Silence like a cancer grows.
                       Bb        F
Hear my words that I might teach you,
                      Bb        F
Take my arms that I might reach you.
       Bb       
But my words    like silent raindrops
F                    Dm      F
fell,                    And echoed
       C        Dm
In the wells of silence

                          C
And the people bowed and prayed
                     Dm
To the neon God they made.
                          Bb    F
And the sign flashed out its warning,
                      Bb    F
In the words that it was forming.
                       Bb
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
     Bb                   F
Are written on the subway walls
                     Dm        F
And tenement halls.        And whispered
       C         Dm      
in the sounds of silence.
