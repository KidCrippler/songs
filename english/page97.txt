Make you feel my love - Adele

A      E      G       D
Dm     A      B7  E7  A

A                            E
    When the rain is blowing in your face
G                          D
    And the whole world is on your case
Dm                      A
    I would offer you a warm embrace
B7              E7      A
    To make you feel my love.

A                                 E
    When evening shadows and the stars appear
G                                 D
    And there is no one there to dry your tears
Dm                         A
    I could hold you for a million years
B7              E7      A
    To make you feel my love.

D                                A
    I know you haven't made your mind up yet
C#7             D             A
    But I would never do you wrong.
D                                 A
    I've known it from the moment that we met
B7                              E7  
No doubt in my mind where you belong

A                         E
    I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
G                            D
    I'd go crawling down the avenue.
Dm                         A
    There's nothing that I wouldn't do
B7              E7      A
    To make you feel my love.

D                                A
    The storms are raging on the rollin' sea.

    And on the highway of regret
D                                   A
    The winds of change are blowing wild and free.
B7                             E7
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.

    To make you feel my love.
B7              E7      A       A
