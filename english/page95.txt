My Way - Frank Sinatra
Lyrics and Music: Paul Anka, Claude Fran√ßois

D  D

     D              D/C#
And now, the end is near
        D7/C            B7
And so I face the final curtain
    Em7               Em7/D
My friend, I'll say it clear
             Em7/C#               D
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
      D    D7               C/D
I've lived    a life that's full
               G             Gm
I've traveled each and every highway
    D/A                   A4
And more, much more than this
A7      G/D   D
I did it my  way

    D               D/C#
Regrets, I've had a few
          D7/C              B7
But then again, too few to mention
  Em7              Em7/D
I did what I had to do
            Em7/C#          D
And saw it through without exemption
   D     D7             C/D
I planned  each charted course
               G             Gm
Each careful step along the byway
     D/A                  A4
And more, much more than this
A7      G/D   D
I did it my   way

                 D    D7               C/D   D7
Yes, there were times,   I'm sure you knew
           G                      G7
When I bit off more than I could chew
 G             Em7                 A7
But through it all, when there was doubt
        F#m7            Bm7
I ate it up and spit it out
           Em7             A7
I faced it all and I stood tall
          G/D  D
And did it my  way

      D                      D/C#
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
           D7/C              B7
I've had my fill my share of losing
    Em7             Em7/D
And now, as tears subside
         Em7/C#    D
I find it all so amusing
    D   D7           C/D
To think   I did all that
           G             Gm
And may I say - not in a shy way
  D/A             A4
Oh no, oh no, not me
A7       G/D  D
I did it my   way

              D   D7             C/D   D7
For what is a man,   what has he got
           G                G7
If not himself, then he has naught
 G          Em7             A7
To say the things he truly feels
            F#m7              Bm7
And not the words of one who kneels
            Em7              A7
The record shows I took the blows
          G/D   D
And did it my   way

D  D7  C/D  D7  G  G  Gm  Gm
D/A  D/A  A4

A7          G/D  D
Yes, it was my   way
