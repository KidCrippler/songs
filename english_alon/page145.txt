Lyrics and Music: Madonna, Patrick Leonard, Bruce Gaitsch

Dm   C   Dm   Dm
Dm             C   Dm   Dm
   Como puede ser verdad
Dm   C   Dm   Dm

Dm             C           Dm
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Bb       Dm        F              C
    Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Dm                C               Dm
A young girl with eyes like the desert
Bb    Dm              F              C  A/C#
   It all seems like yesterday, not far away

 Dm          Am
Tropical the island breeze
Gm             F
All of nature wild and free
  C             Gm
This is where I long to be
          Dm
La isla bonita
Dm           Am
And when the samba played
Gm                F
   The sun would set so high
        C                 Gm
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
                  Dm
Your Spanish lullaby

Dm   C   Dm   Dm
Dm   C   Dm   Dm

Dm         C            Dm
I fell in love with San Pedro
Bb      Dm           F               C
   Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Dm     C      Dm
   Te dijo te amo
Bb    Dm              F                     C      A/C#
   I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

 Dm          Am
Tropical the island breeze
Gm             F
All of nature wild and free
  C             Gm
This is where I long to be
          Dm
La isla bonita
Dm           Am
And when the samba played
Gm                F
   The sun would set so high
        C                 Gm
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
                  Dm
Your Spanish lullaby

Dm   C   Dm   Dm
Dm   C   Dm   Dm

Gm        Eb            F           Csus2
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
          Gm        Eb             F            
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
  Gm      Eb         F            Csus2
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
        Gm           Eb          F   F
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy
 A      Dm   -->
Loves a girl
