Am   Am   Am   Am

Am                /G
     Birds flying high
/F                       /E
     You know how I feel
Am               /G
     Sun in the sky
/F                  E4    E
     You know how I feel
  Am   /G
Reeds driftin' on by
/F#                  F
     You know how I feel
      Am/E
It's a new dawn
       /D
It's a new day
       /C        B7sus4
It's a new life
   Am/D    [Bm/E]
For me

                Am    /G   /F   /E
And I'm feeling good
Am               /G
     Fish in the sea
/F                     /E
     You know how I feel
Am                   /G
     River running free
/F             /E
You know how I feel
 Am             /G
Blossom in the trees
/F#                  F
     You know how I feel
      Am/E
It's a new dawn
       /D
It's a new day
       /C        B7sus4
It's a new life
   Am/D    [Bm/E]
For me
                Am/E    /F   /F#   /F
And I'm feeling good

{Megaphone effect on voice}
{Bass and Drums only}
/A                  /G
     Dragonfly out      in the sun
/F                 /E               /A
   You know what I mean, don't you know
            /G
Butterflies are all havin' fun
/F                /E
     You know what I mean
 /C      /A    /F               /D
Sleep in peace     when day is done
         /C             /A
And this old world is a new world
      /F          /E
And a bold world

{Back to normal}

    Am    /G   /F   /E
For me
Am                   /G
     Stars when you shine
/F                  /E
     You know how I feel
Am                /G
     Scent of the pine
/F                 /E
     You know how I feel
        Am       /G
Yeah, freedom is mine
/F#                     F
     And you know how I   feel
      Am/E
It's a new dawn
       /D
It's a new day
       /C        B7sus4
It's a new life
   Am/D
For me
