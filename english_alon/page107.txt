Am7  Am7  Am7   G  Fmaj7  Fmaj7  Fmaj7  Em7
Dm7  Dm7  Em7  Em7  Am7    Am7    Dm7   Em7

              Am7
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone 
    G    Fmaj7
To let me know you made it home 
           Em7            Dm7       Em7       Am7
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover 

              Am7
If she's with me I'll blink the lights 
    G      Fmaj7
To let you know tonight's the night 
    Em7    Dm7    Em7       Am7
For me and you my part-time lover 

       F                          C
We are undercover passion on the run 
        Dm7                Em7    Am7
Chasing love up against the s  -  un 
          F                         C
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
                 Dm7                  Em7
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 

             Am7
If I'm with friends and we should meet 
      G     Fmaj7
Just pass me by, don't even speak 
         Em7          Dm7       Em7       Am7
Know the word's "discreet" with part-time lovers 

               Am7
But if there's some emergency 
     G      Fmaj7
Have a male friend to ask for me 
   Em7            Dm7                     Em7       Am7
So then she won't peek it's really you my part-time lover 

       F                          C
We are undercover passion on the run 
        Dm7                Em7    Am7
Chasing love up against the s  -  un 
          F                         C
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
                 Dm7                  Em7
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 

              Am7
I've got something that I must tell 
      G       Fmaj7
Last night someone rang our doorbell 
       Em7     Dm7    Em7       Am7
And it was not you my part-time lover 

           Am7
And then a man called our exchange 
     G     Fmaj7
But didn't want to leave his name 
             Em7              Dm7     Em7       Am7
I guess that two can play the game of part-time lovers 
        Dm7  Em7       Am7
You and me,  part-time lovers 
             Dm7  Em7       Am7
But, she and he,  part-time lovers  []
