The Longest Time - Billy Joel
Lyrics and Music: Billy Joel

 C    G   C   F
Woah, oh, oh, oh (for the longest)
 G               C
For the longest time
 G    C   F
Woah, oh, oh (for the longest)
 G
For the longest

C  /B  /A   /G  F            C
If you said goodbye to me tonight
 C    /B     /A   /G  D7              G   - /F -
There would still be  music left to write
E7                Am
   What else could I do
G7            C  -  C7/G  -   F
   I'm so inspired   by you
            Dm                G       C
That hasn't happened for the longest time

C   /B  /A     /G  F              C
Once I thought my  innocence was gone
 C  /B  /A   /G  D7             G   - /F -
Now  I know that happiness goes  on
E7                  Am
   That's where you found me
 G7               C  -  C7/G  -   F
When you put your arms around me
           Dm                 G       C
I haven't been there for the longest time

 C    G   C   F
Woah, oh, oh, oh (for the longest)
 G               C
For the longest time
 G    C   F
Woah, oh, oh (for the longest)
 G
For the longest

C   /B    /A   /G      F              C
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
C   /B  /A   /G  D7        G   - /F -
And the greatest miracle of all
E7           Am
   Is how I need you
G7             C  -  C7/G  -   F
  And how you needed  me too
            Dm                G       C
That hasn't happened for the longest time

 G               Am
Maybe this won't last very long
    B7
But you feel so right
    C
And I could be wrong
Em              Am
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
    D              D7
But I've gone this far
          G    /F    /E    /D
And it's more than I hoped for

 C   /B   /A  /G    F               C
Who knows how much further we'll go on
C  /B  /A   /G  D7               G   - /F -
Maybe  I'll be  sorry when you're gone
E7               Am
   I'll take my chances
G7            C  -  C7/G  -   F
I forgot how nice romance is
           Dm                 G       C
I haven't been there for the longest time

G             Am
I had second thoughts at the start
   B7
I said to myself
     C
Hold on to your heart
Em             Am
Now I know the woman that you are
        D           D7
You're wonderful so far
          G    /F    /E    /D
And it's more than I hoped for

C    /B   /A   /G    F               C
I   don't care what consequence it brings
C /B   /A   /G  D7            G   -  /F  -
I have been  a fool for lesser things
E7            Am
   I want you so bad
G7              C   -   C7/G  -
   I think you ought to know
     F           Dm                G       C
That I intend to hold you for the longest time

 C    G   C   F
Woah, oh, oh, oh (for the longest)
 G               C
For the longest time
 G    C   F
Woah, oh, oh (for the longest)
 G               C
For the longest time
 G    C   F
Woah, oh, oh (for the longest)
 G               C
For the longest time...
