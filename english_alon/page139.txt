Lyrics and Music: Warren Diane Eve

(Am   Dm   G   F) x 2

Am              Dm
Over and over I look in your eyes
        G                       F
You are all I desire, you have captured me
Am                    Dm
I want to hold you, I want to be close to you
G                    F
I never want to let go
Dm                C
I wish that this night would never end
Dm7            F
   I need to know

        Bbm
Could I hold you for for a lifetime
        Ebm
Could I look into your eyes
        G#                                    F#

Over and over I've dreamed of this night
            G                        F
Now you're here by my side, you are next to me
Am                     Dm
I want to hold you and touch you and taste you
     G                       F
And make you want no one but  me
Dm                  Am
   I wish that this kiss could never end (no no)
Dm           F
   Oh baby please
