To The Moon and Back - Savage Garden
Lyrics and Music: Darren Hayes, Daniel Jones

(Am  G  Em  F - G -)x2

       G         [Am]                G
She's taking her time making up the reasons
Em                   F
 To justify all the hurt inside
            Am
Guess she knows from the smile
         G
And the look in their eyes
     Em                            F
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one
                Am 
They're saying  -  Mama never loved her much
    G
And   daddy never keeps in touch
Em                                F
  That's why she shies away from human affection
    Am
But   somewhere in a private place
     G
She packs her bags for outer space
Em                               F
  And now she's waiting for the right
                  F
Kind of pilot to come, and she'll say to him
F/D
   She's saying

Am                      F                       G
  I would fly into the moon and back if you'll be
          Em
If you'll be my baby
Am                    F                G
  Got a ticket for a world where we belong
             Em
So would you be my baby

Am  G  Em

F              G        Am                 G
  She can't remember a time when she felt needed
Em                              F
  If love was red then she was color blind
         Am                                 G
All her friends, they've been trialed for treason
     Em                       F
And crimes that were never defined
             Am
She's saying    love is like a barren place
    G
And   reaching out for human faith is
Em                            F
  It's like a journey I just don't have a map for
   Am
So    baby's gonna take a dive and
G
  Push the shift to overdrive
Em                               F
   And send a signal that she's hanging
                       F 
All her hopes on the stars, what a pleasant dream
F/D
   She's saying

Am                      F                       G
  I would fly into the moon and back if you'll be
          Em
If you'll be my baby
Am                    F                G
  Got a ticket for a world where we belong
             Em          [Am]  G  Em  F
So would you be my baby
