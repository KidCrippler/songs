Bitch - Meredith Brooks
Lyrics and Music: Meredith Brooks and Shelly Peiken

A  D  A  D

   A
I hate the world today
D
  You're so good to me
    A
I know but I can't change
D
  Tried to tell you
        F#m
But you look at me like maybe
       B
I'm an angel underneath
D
  Innocent and sweet

 A
Yesterday I cried
D
  Must have been relieved to
 A
See the softer side
D                      
  I can understand how
F#m
You'd be so confused
B
I don't envy you
       D
I'm a little bit of everything
D
All rolled into one

       A
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
       E
I'm a child, I'm a mother
      Bm
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
  D
I do not feel ashamed
          A
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
     E
I'm nothing in between
              F#m
You know you wouldn't want it
           D
Any other way

    A
So take me as I am
D
  This may mean
                A
You'll have to be a stronger man
D
  Rest assured that
       F#m
When I start to make you nervous
         B
And I'm going to extremes
   D
Tomorrow I will change
       D
And today won't mean a thing

       A
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
       E
I'm a child, I'm a mother
      Bm
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
  D
I do not feel ashamed
          A
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
     E
I'm nothing in between
              F#m
You know you wouldn't want it
           D
Any other way

A  E  F#m  D  A  E  Bm  D 

E
  Just when you think, you got me figured out
    F#m                   D
The season's already changing
E                        F#m
  I think it's cool, you do what you do
     D
And don't try to save me

       A
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
       E
I'm a child, I'm a mother
      Bm
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
  D
I do not feel ashamed
          A
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
     E
I'm nothing in between
              F#m
You know you wouldn't want it
           D
Any other way

       A
I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
       E
I'm a goddess on my knees
         Bm
When you hurt, when you suffer
         D
I'm your angel undercover
           A
I've been numb, I'm revived
       E
Can't say I'm not alive
            F#m
You know I wouldn't want it
           D
Any other way
