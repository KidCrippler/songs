Shivers - Ed Sheeran
Lyrics and Music: Gordon Mills, Ed Sheeran, Gordon Mills Jr

Am   Fmaj7   C   G

                       Am
I took an arrow to the heart
                            Fmaj7
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
                  C
Strawberries and somethin' more
                          G
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
                  Am
Lipstick on my guitar, ooh
                           Fmaj7
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
                 C
Go dancing underneath the stars
                           G
Ooh, yeah, I want it all,      mmm
 
Yeah, you got me feeling like

Am
       I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
Fmaj7
           I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
C
     Like my soul's on fire
                     G
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like

Am
Ooh, I love when you do it like that
                Fmaj7
And when you're close up, you give me thе shivers
         C
Oh baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
               G
And whеn they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back
              Am
And we'll say ooh I love it when you do it like that
                Fmaj7
And when you're close up, you give me the shivers
         C
Oh baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
               G
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

         Am                           Fmaj7
Into the car, on the back seat in the moon lit dark
                         C
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
                      G
Ooh, I can't get enough
                            Am
You know you could tear me apart
                         Fmaj7
Put me back together and take my heart
                              C
I never thought that I could love this hard
                      G
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feeling like

Am
       I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
Fmaj7
           I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
C
     Like my soul's on fire
                     G
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like

Am
Ooh, I love when you do it like that
                Fmaj7
And when you're close up, give me thе shivers

With the fire you got, this thing is started
