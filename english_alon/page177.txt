Feel - Robbie Williams
Lyrics and Music: Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers

{Just Piano}
Dm   Am/D   F/D   G/D
Dm   Am/D   F/D

            G/D     Dm
Come on and hold my hand
Am/C                       A/C#   (  -  Dm/C#     -  )
       I wanna contact the living
A7                      Gm
       Not sure I understand
Dm/F                       A/E   (  -  Dm/E       -  )
       This role I've been given

A7                       Dm
       I sit and talk to God
Am/C                            A/C#   (  -  Dm/C#     -  )
       And he just laughs at my plans
A7                      Gm
       My head speaks a language
Dm/F                 A/E     A7
       I don't understand

              Bb        F
I just wanna feel real love
                      C       C
Feel the home that I live in
                      Bb
'Cause I got too much life
                    F
Running through my veins
          C
Going to waste

C   C#o            Dm
     I don't wanna die
Am/C                              A/C#   (  -  Dm/C#     -  )
       but I ain't keen on living either
A7                      Gm
       Before I fall in love
Dm/F                    A/E        (  -  Dm/E       -  )
       I'm preparing to leave her

A7                       Dm
       I scare myself to death
Am/C                        A/C#     (  -  Dm/C#     -  )
       That's why I keep on running
A7                   Gm
       Before I've arrived
Dm/F                    A/E     A7
       I can see myself coming

              Bb        F
I just wanna feel real love
                      C       C
Feel the home that I live in
                      Bb
'Cause I got too much life
                    F
Running through my veins
          C
Going to waste

               Bb        F
And I need to feel real love
                C
And a life ever after
              Dm    --->
I cannot get enough

Running through my veins

To go to waste

I just wanna feel real love
               C
In a life ever after
                     Bb
There's a hole in my soul

You can see it in my face

It's a real big place
