Deep Purple - Smoke on the water

{Intro} | D4 F4 G4 - | D4 F4 G#4 G4 | D4 F4 G4 - | F4 D4 - - |x6

 
{Verse 1}

   G5 ///          G5 ///
We all came out to Montreux
       G5 /   F5 / G5 ///
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
G5 ///                 G5 ///
To make records with a mobile
G5 /      F5 /      G5 ///
We didn't have much time
G5 ///              G5 ///
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
     G5 /        F5 /  G5 ///
Were at the best place around
G5 ///                 G5 ///
But some stupid with a flare gun
G /              F /    G ///
Burned the place to the ground

{Chorus}

C5 ///       G#5 /// G5 ///             G5 ///
Smoke on the water,     fire in the sky
C5 ///       G#5 ///
Smoke on the water...

{Verse 2}

     G5 ///          G5 ///
They burned down the gambling house
   G5 /         F5 /  G5 ///
It died with an awful sound
G5 ///           G5 ///
Funky Claude was running in and out
G5 /         F5 /
Pulling kids out the ground
G5 ///          G5 ///
When it all was over
   G5 /        F5 /    G5 ///
We had to find another place
G5 ///             G5 ///
But Swiss time was running out
   G5 /                 F5 /     G5 ///
It seemed that we would lose the race

{Chorus}

C5 ///       G#5 /// G5 ///             G5 ///
Smoke on the water,     fire in the sky
C5 ///       G#5 ///
Smoke on the water...

{Verse 3}

G5 ///             G ///
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
G5 /   F5 /  G5 ///
It was empty cold and bare
G5 ///                     G5 ///
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
G5 /       F5 /  G5 ///
Making our music there
       G5 ///               G5 ///
With a few red lights and a few old beds
G5 /      F5 /     G5 ///
We make a place to sweat
G5 ///            G5 ///
No matter what we get out of this
G5 /    F5 /         G5 ///
I know, I know we'll never forget

{Chorus}

C5 ///       G#5 /// G5 ///             G5 ///
Smoke on the water,     fire in the sky
C5 ///       G#5 ///
Smoke on the water...
