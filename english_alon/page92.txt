Can You Feel The Love Tonight - Elton John
Lyrics and Music: Elton John

A  E/G#  D/A  A/E  D  A/C#  E/G# - A - Bm7 - E - 

 D                 A     D               A
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
  D                 A            Bm7             E
When the heat of a rolling world can be turned away
D             A      D                 A
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
D                    F#m               G               E
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

     A      E/G#     F#m    D
And can you feel the love tonight
A        D   B/Eb  E     
  It is where we   are
D        A             F#m  A/E   D
  It's enough for this wide eyed wanderer
 Bm  A/C#  D   B/Eb   E
That  we  got  this  far
     A      E/G#     F#m    D
And can you feel the love tonight
A           D   B/Eb  E     
  How it's laid  to  rest
D        A            F#m   A/E  D
  It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
  Bm    A/C#   D   D/A   A
Believe the   ve - ry   best

A  E/G#  D/A  A/E  D  A/C#  E/G# - A - Bm7 - E - 

  D                A        D              A
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
  D                  A         Bm7              E
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
  D                  A     D               A
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
  D                     F#m
When the heart of this star crossed voyager
 G                  E
beats in time with yours

     A      E/G#     F#m    D
And can you feel the love tonight
A        D   B/Eb  E     
  It is where we   are
D        A             F#m  A/E   D
  It's enough for this wide eyed wanderer
 Bm  A/C#  D   B/Eb   E
That  we  got  this  far
     A      E/G#     F#m    D
And can you feel the love tonight
A           D   B/Eb  E     
  How it's laid  to  rest
D        A            F#m   A/E  D
  It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
  Bm    A/C#   D   D/A   A
Believe the   ve - ry   best
D        A            F#m   A/E  D
  It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
  Bm    A/C#   D   D/A   A
Believe the   ve - ry   best
