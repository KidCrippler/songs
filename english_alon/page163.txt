C                                    G
   I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy
F                                   G                             C
   I'll be your hope, I'll be your love be everything that you need
                             G                        F
I love you more with every breath truly madly deeply do
F                            G
I will be strong I will be faithful 'cos I'm counting on 
  Am
A new beginning
   G
A reason for living
   F                G
A deeper meaning, yeah

          C                   G
I wanna stand with you on a mountain
         F                    G
I wanna bath with you in the sea
         C               G
I wanna lay like this forever
           F                 G
Until the sky falls down on me

C                                   G
   And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky
F                               G                             C
   I'll make a wish send it to heaven then make you want to cry
C                              G
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty
F                                G
   That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection of
    Am
The highest power
    G
In lonely hours
     F            G
The tears devour you

          C                   G
I wanna stand with you on a mountain
         F                    G
I wanna bath with you in the sea
         C               G
I wanna lay like this forever
           F                 G
Until the sky falls down on me

F                G
   Oh can't you see it baby?
F
   You don't have to close your eyes
G                                   F
   'cos it's standing right before you
F             G                C    -->
All that you need will surely come 

-->  C   G   F   G
