The Way - Fastball
Lyrics and Music: Tony Scalzo

Em  Em

     Em
They made up their minds
                 Am
And they started packing
     B7                               Em
They left before the sun came up that day
   E7                      Am
An exit to eternal summer slacking
     Em                      B7
But where were they going without ever
            Em   Em
Knowing the way?

     Em
They drank up the wine
                Am
And they got to talking
     B7                               Em
They now had more important things to say
     E7                                  Am
And when the car broke down they started walking
 Em                      B7                    Em    D
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?

                    G                         D
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
    Em                           B7
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
         C                         G                  D   D
They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and grey
                    G               D
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
     Em                          B7
They won't make it home but they really don't care
      C                           G               D     B7  B7
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today

       Em
Their children woke up
                  Am
And they couldn't find them
     B7                               Em
They left before the sun came up that day
     E7                               Am
They just drove off and left it all behind 'em
     Em                      B7                    Em    D
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?

                    G                         D
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
    Em                           B7
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
         C                         G                  D   D
They'll never get hungry, they'll never get old and grey
                    G               D
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
     Em                          B7
They won't make it home but they really don't care
      C                           G               D     B7  B7
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today
