[Dm]
Half past twelve
         G                                     
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
                                      Dm
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Dm
Autumn winds
         G
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
                                         Dm
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
Gm/Bb
      There's not a soul out there
Gm                          Dm/A   A
    No one to hear my prayer

Dm          Gm/Bb   C9        Dm
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Gm/Bb          Dm                    C      Dm
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Dm          Gm/Bb   C9        Dm
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Gm/Bb                Dm               C           Dm
 Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

(Dm   F   Am   Dm) x 2

[Dm]
Movie stars
         G
Find the end of the rainbow, with that fortune to win
                                            Dm
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Dm
Tired of TV
  G
I open the window and I gaze into the night
                                            Dm
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
Gm/Bb
      There's not a soul out there
Gm                          Dm/A   A
    No one to hear my prayer

Dm          Gm/Bb   C9        Dm
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Gm/Bb          Dm                    C      Dm
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Dm          Gm/Bb   C9        Dm
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Gm/Bb                Dm               C           Dm
 Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Dm          Gm/Bb   C9        Dm
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Gm/Bb          Dm                    C      Dm
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Dm          Gm/Bb   C9        Dm
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Gm/Bb                Dm               C           Dm
 Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
