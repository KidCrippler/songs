Lyrics and Music: Aretha Franklin and Ted White

(Bb  Eb/Bb -) x 4

Bb
Think (Think) Think (Think) Think (Think) Think (Think)
You Think (Think) Think (Think) Think About (Think)

            Bb                                     Eb       F7    Bb
You better think (think), think about what you're trying to do to me
       Bb                                     Eb      F7       Bb
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself be free
                  
Bb                                         Eb     F7    Bb
Let's go back, let's go back, let's go way on way back when
Bb
I didn't even know you
                       Eb       F7        Bb
You couldn't have been too much more than ten (just a child)
Bb                                  Eb     F7      Bb
I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degrees
Bb                                Eb              F7       Bb
It don't take too much high IQ to see what you're doing to me

            Bb                                     Eb       F7    Bb
You better think (think), think about what you're trying to do to me
      Bb                                     Eb      F7       Bb
Now, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

    Bb                 C#                 Eb            Bb
Oh freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, yeah freedom
 Bb                 C#                 Eb              Bb
Freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, ooh freedom

 B
Hey, think about it! You, think about it!
B
  There ain't nothing you could ask
        E      F#         B
I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
    B
And I was gonna change, but I'm not
        E          F#       B
If you keep doing things I don't

 B                            E        F#     B

 B                                      E        F#       B
People walking around everyday playing games and taking scores
 B
Trying to make other people lose their minds
          E          F#          B
Well, be careful you don't lose yours

     B                                       E       F#     B
Oh, think (think), think about what you're trying to do to me
           B                                    E      F#       B
Yeah yeah yeah yeah (think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

 E
You need me (need me) and I need you (don't you know it?)
Without each other there ain't nothing neither can do

 B
