Nothing's Gonna Change My Love For You - Glenn Medeiros
Lyrics and Music: Michael Masser and Gerry Goffin

C   F   G   E   Am   D7   Dm - Em - F - G -
 
      C             G/B              Am
If I had to live my life without you near me
    Em/G              Fmaj7    C/E
The days would all be empty
    Dm                    G
The nights would seem so long

      C          G/B          Am
With you I see forever oh so clearly
  Em/G               Fmaj7        C/E
I might have been in love before
       Dm                F/G
But it never felt this strong

    Fmaj7               C/E
Our dreams are young and we both know
        Bb/C             Fmaj7
They'll take us where we want to go
Dm7         C/E
Hold me now touch me now
F               F/G             G
I don't want to live without you

 C                        Fmaj7
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
     G                       E7
You ought to know by now how much I love you
Am                D7
    One thing you can be sure of
F                       G
    I'll never ask for more than your love

 C                        Fmaj7
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
     G                       E7
You ought to know by now how much I love you
Am                           D7
    The world may change my whole life through but
 F               F/G                C     C
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

C            G/B            Am
If the road ahead is not so easy
    Em/G              Fmaj7        C/E
Our love will lead the way for us
Dm7              G
Like a guiding star
C                 G/B                Am
I'll be there for you if you should need me
Em/G               Fmaj7             C/E
 You don't have to change a thing
           Dm7              F/G
I love you just the way you are

   Fmaj7            C/E
So come with me and share the view
     Bb/C           Fmaj7
I'll help you see forever too
Dm7          C
Hold me now touch me now
F               F/G             G
I don't want to live without you

 C                        Fmaj7
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
     G                       E7
You ought to know by now how much I love you
Am                D7
    One thing you can be sure of
F                       G
    I'll never ask for more than your love

 C                        Fmaj7
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
     G                       E7
You ought to know by now how much I love you
Am                           D7
    The world may change my whole life through but
 F               F/G                C  --->
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
