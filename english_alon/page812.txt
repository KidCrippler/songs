Eric Clepton - Cocaine


If you want to hang out, you've gotta take her out, cocaine

If you want to get down, get down on the ground, cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie,
cocaine

If you got that lose, you want to kick them blues, cocaine

When your day is done, and you want to ride on cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie,
cocaine



If your day is gone, and you want to ride onâ€¦
