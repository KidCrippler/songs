A  A  E  E  D  D  D

      A
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
       E                                 D
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey, hey
    A
She acts like summer and walks like rain
   E                                           D
Reminds me that there's a time to change hey, hey, hey
 A
Since the return from her stay on the moon
     E                                                D
She listens like spring and she talks like June hey, hey, hey

     E                                B
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
                              D
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
A
  And that heaven is overrated?
 E                                     B
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
                         [Bm]
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were
 D                         A     A  E  E  D  D  D  D
looking for yourself out there?

      A
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
  E                                        D
Tracing her way through the constellation hey, hey, hey
      A
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
   E                                         D
Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, hey, hey
     A
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
       E                                       D
I'm afraid that she might think of me as      plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who was
too afraid to fly so he never did land

     E                                        B
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
                                   D
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
A
  And head back to the Milky Way?
     E                                  B
And tell me,       did Venus blow your mind?
                                [Bm]
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were
 D                         A     A  E  E  D  D  D  D
looking for yourself out there?

                    A
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken?
      E                          D
Your best friend always sticking up for you
even when I know you're wrong
                    A
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance
 E
five-hour phone conversation?
    [G]                                   D
The best soy latte that you ever had and me

     E                                        B
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
                                   D
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
A
  And head back toward the Milky Way?
     E                                B
And tell me, did you sail across the sun?
                              D
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
A
  And that heaven is overrated?
     E                                     B
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star,
                        [Bm]
One without a permanent scar?
                                    D
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?  []

 A                 E                D
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
And did you finally get the chance to dance
along the light of day?
A                  E
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
             D
And did you fall for a shooting star, fall for a shooting star?
A                  E
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
               [G]                               D
And now you're lonely looking for yourself out there
