  G
When I'm with you baby, I go out of my head
       C
and I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough
G
All the things you do to me, and everything you said
       C
and I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
D                          Em
   We slip and slide as we fall in love,
       C                  D
And I just can't seem to get enough of

G
   We walk together, we're walking down the street
       C
and I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough
G
Every time I think of you, I know we have to meet
       C
and I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough
D                              Em
   It's getting harder, it's a burning love
       C                  D
And I just can't seem to get enough of

   G
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   C
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   G
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   C
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   G
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   C
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   G
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   C
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

{Just Drums}
And when it rains, you're shining down for me
and I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow, you know you set me free
and I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough 

{Everyone Joins}
D                              Em
  You're like an angel and you give me your love
       C                  D
And I just can't seem to get enough of

   G
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   C
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   G
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   C
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   G
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   C
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   G
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
   C
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough
