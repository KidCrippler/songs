Livin' La Vida Loca - Ricky Martin
Lyrics and Music: Robi Rosa, Desmond Child, Luis GÃ³mez Escolar

Bm   Bm   Bm   Bm

Bm        
  She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall

Bm   Bm

Bm
  She's into new sensation
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night

       Em                
She'll make you take your clothes off
       F#m
and go dancing in the rain
        G
She'll make you live her crazy life
           A7
but she'll take away the pain
       F#7                    
Like a bullet to your brain (C'mon!)

Bm
Upside, inside out,  
     Asus2           Bm
She's livin' la vida loca
       Bm
She'll push and pull you down
Asus2          Bm
Livin' la Vida Loca
    Bm
Her lips are devil red
        Asus2             Bm       
And her skin is the color mocha
Bm
She will wear you out
Asus2         Bm
Livin' la vida loca
Asus2         Bm
Livin' la vida loca
      Asus2          Bm
She's livin' la vida loca

Bm   Bm   Bm   Bm

Bm 
  Woke up in New York city
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleeping pill

    Em
She never drinks the water
          F#m7
makes you order french champagne
G
Once you've had a taste of her
       A7
you'll never be the same
             F#7             
Yeah, she'll make you go insane (C'mon!)

Bm
Upside, inside out,  
     Asus2           Bm
She's livin' la vida loca
       Bm
She'll push and pull you down
Asus2          Bm
Livin' la Vida Loca
    Bm
Her lips are devil red
        Asus2             Bm       
And her skin is the color mocha
Bm
She will wear you out
Asus2         Bm
Livin' la vida loca
Asus2         Bm
Livin' la vida loca
      Asus2          Bm
