Hopelessly Devoted To You - Olivia Newton John
Lyrics and Music: John Farrar

Dm   A   Dm   A
Dm  -  /E  -  /F  -  /G  -   A

       A              C#m7          D
Guess mine is not the first heart broken
   Bm7              E7       Amaj7       A6
My eyes are not the first to cry
     A                F#7
I'm not the first to know
        G6              F#7  Bm7
There's just no gettin' over you

C#m7   C#m7  -  Cm7  -   Bm7  -  E7  -

   A              C#m7        D
I know I'm just a fool who's willing
   Bm7          E7                Amaj7       A6
To sit around        and wait for you
      A              F#7
But, baby, can't you see?
 G6                      F#7   Bm7
There's nothin' else for me to do
    C#m7       Cm7  Bm7  /E     Dm   /E   /F   /G    A
I'm hopelessly de - voted    to you

                Gm7
But now there's nowhere to hide
                          C7    C+
Since you pushed my love aside
    F         Fmaj7  Ao                    Gm7
I'm out of my head,  hopelessly devoted to you
C7                    Dm   /C#   /C   /B
Hopelessly devoted to you      (oooohh)
Gm7          C7       Dm   /E   /F   /G    A
Hopelessly devoted to you

    A              C#m7            D
My head is sayin',      "Fool, forget him"
   Bm7              E7            Amaj7       A6
My heart is sayin',    "Don't let go"
 A             F#7  G6              F#7     Bm7
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do
    C#m7       Cm7  Bm7  /E     Dm   /E   /F   /G    A
I'm hopelessly de - voted    to you

                Gm7
But now there's nowhere to hide
                          C7    C+
Since you pushed my love aside
    F         Fmaj7  Ao                    Gm7
I'm out of my head,  hopelessly devoted to you
C7                    Dm   /C#   /C   /B
Hopelessly devoted to you      (oooohh)
Gm7          C7       Bbm   /C   /C#   /D#    F
Hopelessly devoted to you
