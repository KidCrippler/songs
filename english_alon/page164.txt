{Talking intro}
We're so glad to see so many of you lovely people here tonight
and we would especially like to welcome all the representatives of
Illinois' Law Enforcement Community who have chosen to join us here
in the Palace Hotel Ballroom at this time.
We do sincerely hope you'll all enjoy the show, and please remember people,
that no matter who you are, and what you do to live, thrive and survive,
there are still some things that make us all the same.
You, me, them, everybody, everybody.

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love
Someone to love (someone to love)
Sweetheart to miss (sweetheart to miss)
Sugar to kiss (sugar to kiss)
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you in the morning
I need you, you, you when my soul's on fire

Am
   Sometimes I feel
F
   I feel a little sad inside
Am
   When my baby mistreats me

I never, never, never have a place to hide

{Just Drums}
You know people when you do find somebody
Hold that woman, hold that man
Love him, please him, squeeze her, please her
Hold, squeeze and please that person, give 'em all your love
Signify your feelings with every gentle caress
Because it's so important to have that special somebody
to hold, kiss, miss, squeeze and please
