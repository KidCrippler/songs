Thinking Out Loud - Ed Sheeran
Lyrics and Music: Ed Sheeran, Amy Wadge

C  C/E                                 F               G
   When your legs don't work like they used to before
C  C/E                                F     G
   And I can't sweep you off of your feet
C  C/E                                 F                 G
   Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
C  C/E                                    F       G
   Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

             C  C/E             F    G         C   C/E   F   G
And darling, I  will be loving you 'til we're 70
          C  C/E                    F   G       C   C/E
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
                   F    G
And I'm thinking 'bout how
Dm                        G7       C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Dm                        G7
Maybe just the touch of a hand
      Dm                             G7        Am
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
   Dm                       G7   G7
And I just wanna tell you I am

            C   C/E
So, honey, now
F   G                       C    C/E
   Take me into your loving arms
F   G                            C        C/E
   Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
F   G                             C     C/E
   Place your head on my beating heart
             F    G
I'm thinking out loud
      Am  G     F   C/E   Dm    G7  C 
Maybe we found love right where we  are

C  C/E                                F           G
  When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
C  C/E                               F   G
   And the crowds don't remember my name
C  C/E                  F                    G         C
   When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmm...)
   C/E                                 F    G
    I know you will still love me the same

                C   C/E               F   G               C   C/E   F   G	
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
            C   C/E             F      G           C   C/E
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
                   F    G
And I'm thinking 'bout how
Dm                        G7       C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Dm                        G7
Maybe it's all part of a plan
      Dm                           G7      Am
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Dm                       G7   G7
Hoping that you'll understand

             C   C/E
That, baby, now
F   G                       C    C/E
   Take me into your loving arms
F   G                            C        C/E
   Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
F   G                             C     C/E
   Place your head on my beating heart
             F    G
I'm thinking out loud
      Am  G     F   C/E   Dm    G7  C 
Maybe we found love right where we  are (oh, oh)

(C  C/E  F  G) x4

           C   C/E
So, baby, now
F   G                       C    C/E
   Take me into your loving arms
F   G                            C        C/E
   Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
     F        G                             C    C/E
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
             F    G
I'm thinking out loud
          Am  G     F   C/E   Dm    G7  C 
But maybe we found love right where we  are
          Am  G     F   C/E   Dm    G7  C 
Oh, baby, we found love right where we  are
    Am  G     F   C/E   Dm    G7  C 
And we found love right where we  are
