As Long As You Love Me - Backstreet Boys
Lyrics and Music: Max Martin

F   C   Am      G
            As long as you love me
F   C   Am      G

         Am
Although loneliness has always been
    F
a friend of mine
     G                       C     G/B
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
Am                            F 
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
 G                    C     G/B
Risking it all in a glance
    Am                               F
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
   G                       C     G/B
I can't get you out of my head
Am                                  F
Don't care what is written in your history
    G                          [C]
As long as you're here with me

               F
I don't care who you are
  C                 Am
Where you're from, what you did
    G
As long as you love me
  F
Who you are
  C                 Am
Where you're from, what you did
    G
As long as you love me

Am                                F
Every little thing that you have said and done
 G                           C   G/B
Feels like it's deep within me  (ooohhh)
Am                              F 
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
    G                           [C]
It seems like we're meant to be

               F
I don't care who you are (who you are)
  C
Where you're from (where you're from)
 Am
What you did
    G
As long as you love me (I don't know)
  F
Who you are (who you are)
  C
Where you're from (where you're from)
           Am/F     Am/E
Don't care what you did
   G/D         G/C           F     -->
As long as you love me (yeah-eh-eh)

-->  F   C   Am      E
                 As long as you love me

Am                                C
   I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
G/B         F
     But I guess it shows
          F      G     Am
When you look into my eyes
                               C 
What you did and where you're comin' from
       F#m7b5       Fmaj7        G          F -->
I don't care,    as long as you love me, baby

-->  F   C   Am   G
      Whoooooooooooooo               

               F
I don't care who you are (who you are)
  C
Where you're from (where you're from)
 Am
What you did
    G
As long as you love me (long as you love me)
  F
Who you are (who you are)
  C
Where you're from (where you're from)
           Am/F     Am/E
Don't care what you did
   G/D         G/C                F
As long as you love me (as you love me)
              C

As long as you love me
