Always Remember Us This Way - Lady Gaga
Lyrics and Music: Lady Gaga, Natalie Hemby, Hillary Lindsey, Lori McKenna

              Am                 F
That Arizona sky burning in your eyes
    C                                       G
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
                  Am                    F
It’s buried in my soul like California gold
     C                                     G
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find

            F                                   C
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
      Am                            G
Every time we say goodbye baby, it hurts
          F   G   Am            F    G     C
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
     F        G               C
I'll always remember us this way

              Am                    F
Lovers in the night poets trying to write
   C                                   G
We don't know how to rhyme but damn we try
                 Am                        F
But all I really know you're where I wanna go
    C                                G
The part of me that's you will never die

            F                                   C
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
      Am                            G
Every time we say goodbye baby, it hurts
          F   G   Am            F    G     C
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
     F        G              Bb
I'll always remember us this way (Oh yeah)

F                                      C
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
C                              Bb
Hoo-oo-oo, hoo-oo-oo, oo - oo
                               F
Hoo-oo-oo, hoo-oo-oo, oo - oo
                           G
Hoo-oo-oo, hoo-oo-oo, oo - oo

            F                                   C
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
      Am                            G
Every time we say goodbye baby, it hurts
          F   G   Am            F    G     C
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
     F        G          Am
I'll always remember us        this way (Woah yeah)

         F    G  Am          F     G     C
When you look at me and the whole world fades
     F        G
I'll always remember us.....
          F    Bb    F    C
This way
