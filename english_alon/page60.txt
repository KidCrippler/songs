Am  Am  Dm  G
Am  Am  Dm  G

Am                                   Em
There was a time when we sailed on together
E7                                     Am
Once had a dream that we shared on the way
      F                                       C
And there was a place where we used to seek shelter
Dm                 Bb                         E
  I never knew the pain of the price I would pay

Am                               Em
You led me on with a cloak and a dagger
    E7                                Am
And I didn't know you had made other plans
     F                                  C
You had me believe we were meant for forever
Dm                   Bb                           E
 I really thought my heart would be safe in your hands

Am       F              C
Lorelei,   My ship has passed you by
                Dm
And though you promised me to show the way
 E
You led me astray
            Am      F                C
You were my Lorelei    What kind of fool was I?
           Dm
'Cause I believed in every word you said
     E                     Am
And now I wonder why, Lorelei?

Am  Am  Dm  G
Am  Am  Dm  G

     Am                                Em
And there was a time when we held one another
E7                                    Am
Baring our souls in the light of the flame
  F                                      C
Those were the days, now I've lost my illusions
Dm                      Bb                         E
Sometimes I wake in the night and I call out your name

Bm       G              D
Lorelei,   My ship has passed you by
                Em
And though you promised me to show the way
 F#
You led me astray
            Bm      G               D
You were my Lorelei   What kind of fool was I?
            Em
'Cause I believed in every word you said
    F#                    Bm
And now I wonder why, Lorelei?

G - A - Bm  Em  Am

    Am                                     Em
And now there's a light that shines on the river
 E7                           Am
Blinding my eyes from so far away
  F                                    C
Shot through the heart but now I know better
   Dm                 Bb                       E
As hard as it is to resist the song that you play

Bm       G              D
Lorelei,   My ship has passed you by
                Em
And though you promised me to show the way
 F#
You led me astray
            Bm      G               D
You were my Lorelei   What kind of fool was I?
            Em
'Cause I believed in every word you said
    F#                    Bm   Bm   Em   A
And now I wonder why, Lorelei?

Bm  Bm  Em  A
