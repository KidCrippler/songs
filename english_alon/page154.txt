Lyrics: Lou Bega   Music: Damaso Perez Prado

Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo No. 5

{Synth}        Em   D
{Drums + Bass}  Em   D

Em
One, two, three four, five
      D
Everybody in the car so come on let's ride
       Em
To the    liquor store around the corner
                   D
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna

{Everyone join}

A7/E
    Beerbust like I had last week
   D
I must stay deep 'cause talk is a cheap
       A7/E
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
    D
And as I continue you know they're gettin' sweeter
A7/E
    So what can I do I really beg you my Lord
D
    To me flirtin' it's just like a sport
A7/E                               D
Anything fly it's all good let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

                A7/E
A little bit of Monica in my life
                D
A little bit of Erica by my side
                A7/E
A little bit of Rita is all I need
                 D
A little bit of Tina is what I see
                A7/E
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
                 D
A little bit of Mary all night long
                A7/E
A little bit of Jessica here I am
                D
A little bit of you makes me your man

     A7/E
Jump up and down and move it all around
            D
Shake your head to the sound put your hands an the ground
    A7/E
Take one step left and one step right
D
One to the front and one to the side
A7/E
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
           D
And if it looks like this then you doin' it right

                A7/E
A little bit of Monica in my life
                D
A little bit of Erica by my side
                A7/E
A little bit of Rita is all I need
                 D
A little bit of Tina is what I see
                A7/E
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
                 D
A little bit of Mary all night long
                A7/E
A little bit of Jessica here I am
                D
A little bit of you makes me your man
