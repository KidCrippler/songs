C           Dm
Uptown Girl
                         Em            F
She's been living in her uptown world
           G           C               Dm
I bet she never had a back street guy
                     Em            F
I bet her mama never told her why
           G
I'm gonna try for an

C           Dm
Uptown girl
                         Em                 F
She's been living in her white bread world
           G            C             Dm
As long as anyone with hot blood can
                            Em            F
And now she's looking for a downtown man
              G
That's what I am

G#              Fm
  And when she knows what
    Bbm            Eb
She wants from her time
G#             Fm
  And when she wakes up
    Gm7b5        C
And makes up her mind
F                Dm
  She'll see I'm not so tough
Gm
Just because
G
I'm in love with an

C            Dm
Uptown girl
                              Em            F
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
               G            C               Dm
She's getting tired of her high class toys
                              Em             F
And all her presents from her uptown boys
              G
She's got a choice

Eb              F              D/F#            Gm      F
  Whoo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oah
Eb              F              D/F#             G       G
  Whoo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oah

C            Dm
Uptown girl
                           Em              F
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
           G                C             Dm
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
                               Em             F
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
              G
And then I'll win

G#               Fm
  And when she's walking
      Bbm        Eb
She's looking so fine
G#               Fm
  And when she's talking
       Gm7b5          C
She'll say that she's mine
F                Dm
  She'll say I'm not so tough
Gm
Just because
G
I'm in love with an

C           Dm

Eb              F              D/F#             G       G

Uptown girl
                Em
She's my uptown girl
      F          G
