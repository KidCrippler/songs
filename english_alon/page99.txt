Angels - Robbie Williams
Lyrics and Music: Guy Chambers, Robbie Williams

D      D

           D                          G            A
I sit and wait, does an angel contemplate my fate
              D
And do they know the places where we go
                    G     A
When we're grey and old
                   Em
'Cause I have been told
         G                Bm7            G
That salvation lets their wings unfold
             C
So when I'm lying in my bed
          G/B
Thoughts running through my head
       D
And I feel the love is dead
C             G/B        D
   I'm loving angels instead
	
               A                    Bm
And through it all she offers me protection
                     G                              D
A lot of love and affection, whether I'm right or wrong
                   A                    Bm
And down the waterfall, wherever it may take me
                         G                      F#m
I know that life won't break me, when I come to call
            [Em]
She won't forsake me
C             G/B        D
   I'm loving angels instead

D
   When I'm feeling weak
                         G               A
And my pain walks down a one way street
         D
I look above
                            G                 A
And I know I'll always be blessed with love

    C
And as the feeling grows
              G/B
She breathes flesh to my bones
      D
And when love is dead
C             G/B        D
   I'm loving angels instead

               A                    Bm
And through it all she offers me protection
                     G                              D
A lot of love and affection, whether I'm right or wrong
                   A                    Bm
And down the waterfall, wherever it may take me
                         G                      F#m
I know that life won't break me, when I come to call
            [Em]
She won't forsake me
C             G/B       D
   I'm loving angels instead

               A                    Bm
And through it all she offers me protection
                     G                              D
A lot of love and affection, whether I'm right or wrong
