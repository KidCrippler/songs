Back For Good - Take That
Lyrics and Music: Gary Barlow

D  Em7  G  D - A -
D  Em7  G  D - A - [][]

D        Em7          G   A
  I guess   now it's time
               D
For me to give up 
Em7             G   D - A -
   I feel it's time 
       D               Em7
Got a picture of you beside me 
            G
Got you're lipstick mark
      A                 
still on your coffee cup
D  Em7     G   D - A -
      (Oh yeah)
       D            Em7
Got a fist of pure emotion 
       G                  A
Got a head of shattered dreams 
       Bm             Bm/A        
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all
   G      D - A -
behind now 

    D               Em7                   G
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
        A                 D
I just want you back for good
               Em7
(Want you back,   want you back
G                    A
  want you back for good)
    D                   Em7
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song
          G
and I'll sing it
           A               D
You'll be right and understood 
               Em7
(Want you back,   want you back
G                    A
  want you back for good)

D        Em7           G   A
  Unaware   but underlined
                     D          Em7
I figured out this story (no no)
           G          A
It wasn't good (no no)
            D           Em7                 G    A
But in the corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
              D     Em7
I celebrated glory 
          G         D - A -
But that was not to be 
         D          Em7
In the twist of separation
       G                A
You excelled at being free 
          Bm
Can't you find (can't you find)
         Bm/A            G  A
a little room inside for me 

    D               Em7                   G
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
        A                 D
I just want you back for good
               Em7
(Want you back,   want you back
G                    A
  want you back for good)
    D                   Em7
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song
          G
and I'll sing it
           A               D
You'll be right and understood 
               Em7
(Want you back,   want you back
G                    A
  want you back for good)

Bb7                 D/F#
   And we'll be together
Bb7               D/F#
   This time is forever 
Em7                        D/F#
   We'll be fighting and forever we will be 
       Bm          Bm/A
So complete in our love 
        Bb7        D/F#       A   A   A7
We will never be uncovered again 

    D               Em7                   G
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
        A                 D
I just want you back for good
               Em7
(Want you back,   want you back
G                    A
  want you back for good)
    D                   Em7
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song
          G
and I'll sing it
           A               D
You'll be right and understood 
               Em7
(Want you back,   want you back
G                    A
  want you back for good)

    D               Em7                   G
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
        A                 D
I just want you back for good
               Em7
(Want you back,   want you back
G                    A
  want you back for good)
    D                   Em7
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song
          G
and I'll sing it
           A               D
You'll be right and understood 
               Em7
(Want you back,   want you back
G                    A
  want you back for good)

D  Em7     G   D - A -
      (Oh Yeah)
D   Em7             G
  I guess now it's time
      D        A           D
That you came back... for good
