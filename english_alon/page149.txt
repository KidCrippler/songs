Young man, there's no need to feel down
        Dm
I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground
        Bb
I said, young man, 'cause you're in a new town
            C   Bb  C  Bb  C
There's no need to be   unhappy

 F
Young man, there's a place you can go
        Dm
I said, young man, when you're short on your dough
         Bb
You can stay there, and I'm sure you will find
      C   Bb  C   Bb  C         C
Many ways to have a  good time

                        F
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
                        Dm
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
          Gm
They have everything for young men to enjoy
        C7
You can hang out with all the boys

                        F
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
                        Dm
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
        Gm
You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal
        C7
You can do whatever you feel

 F
Young man, are you listening to me
        Dm
I said, young man, what do you wanna be
        Bb
I said, young man, you can make real your dreams
         C  Bb  C   Bb   C
But you got to know this one thing

 F
No man does it all by himself
        Dm
I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf
         Bb
And just go there, to the YMCA
           C  Bb   C   Bb   C       C
I'm sure they can help you today

                        F
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
                        Dm
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
          Gm
They have everything for young men to enjoy
        C7
You can hang out with all the boys

                        F
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
                        Dm
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
        Gm
You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal
        C7
You can do whatever you feel

 F
Young man, I was once in your shoes
        Dm
I said, I was down and out with the blues
       Bb
I felt no man cared if I were alive
        C  Bb     C    Bb   C
I felt the whole world was so jive

 F
That's when someone came up to me
           Dm
And said, "Young man, take a walk up the street
           Bb
There's a place there called the Y M C A
           C   Bb  C    Bb  C         C
They can start you back on your way"

                        F
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
                        Dm
It's fun to stay at the YMCA
          Gm
They have everything for young men to enjoy
        C7
You can hang out with all the boys

F
