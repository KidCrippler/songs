Em7        D/F#       G
   Tell me something girl
C                         G      D
   Are you happy in this modern world?
Em7      D/F#      G
   Or do you need more?
C                                  G         D
   Is there something else you’re searching for?

Em7   D/F#     G
I’m   fall  -  in'
C                           G      D           
   In all the good times I find myself longin'
Em7  D/F#    G
     For   change
C                          G      D
   And in the bad times I fear myself

Em7        D/F#       G
   Tell me something boy
C                              G         D
   Aren’t you tired tryin' to fill that void
Em7      D/F#      G
   Or do you need more?
C                            G      D
   Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore

Em7   D/F#     G
I’m   fall  -  in'
C                           G      D           
   In all the good times I find myself longin'
Em7  D/F#    G
     For   change
C                          G      D
   And in the bad times I fear myself

Am               /G   D/F#
I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
G          D/F#      Em7
I’ll never meet the ground
Am                    /G    D/F#
Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us
       G           D/F#    Em7
We’re far from the shallow now

Am         /G    D/F#
   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
G          D           Em7
   In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
Am         /G    D/F#
   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
       G           D/F#    Em7   Em7
We’re far from the shallow now

Bm      D
Woo, aaaah
  A     Em7
Woaaaaaaaaaa
Bm       D    A
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh

Am                    D/F#
I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
G          D         Em7
I’ll never meet the ground
Am                          D/F#
Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us
       G           D       Em7
We’re far from the shallow now

Am         /G    D/F#
   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
G          D           Em7
   In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
Am         /G    D/F#
   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
       G           D/F#    Em7
We’re far from the shallow now
