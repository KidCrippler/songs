When You Say Nothing At All - Ronan Keating
Lyrics and Music: Paul Overstreet and Don Schlitz

G        D          C             D           G      D  C  D
  It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart 
G          D        C             D            G     D  C  D
  Without saying a word, you can light up the dark 
 C                   D
Try as I may, I can never explain 
G         D             C            D   D4   D   D4
  What I hear when you don't say a thing 

      G            D             C            D
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me 
            G           D            C            D
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me 
     G             D                C                   D    C   D
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall 
 C               D                             G  -->
You say it best,   when you say nothing at all 

-->  G   D   C   D
     G   D   C   D

G          D          C           D           G    D  C  D
  All day long I can hear people talking out loud 
G/E           D           C          D             G   D  C  D
    But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd 
 C                         D
Try as they may, they can never define 
G               D           C              D
  What's been said between your heart and mine 

      G            D             C            D
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me 
            G           D            C            D
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me 
     G             D                C                   D    C   D
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall 
 C               D                             E  -->
You say it best,   when you say nothing at all 

-->  (E   B   A   B) x 3

      G            D             C            D
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me 
            G           D            C                    D
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me 
     G             D                C                   D    C   D
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall 
 C                           D                            G  -->
You say it best (you say it best) when you say nothing at all 

--> G   D   C   D
    G   D   C   D

  G          D                 C         D
(You say it best when you say nothing at all)
  G          D                 C         D
(You say it best when you say nothing at all)
      G            D          C           D
The smile on your face, the truth in your eyes
     G             D             C            D
The touch of your hand lets me know that you need me
  G          D                 C         D
(You say it best when you say nothing at all)
  G          D                 C         D
(You say it best when you say nothing at all)
