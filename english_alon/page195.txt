Lyrics and Music: Tim Rice-Oxley, Tom Chaplin, Richard Hughes

Bb   Dm   Cm   F4  -  F  -

Bb                     Dm
      I walked across         an empty land
Cm                                F4          F
      I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
Bb                      Dm
      I felt the earth             beneath my feet
Cm                            F4          F
      Sat by the river and it made me complete

Gm                      Dm
       Oh simple thing        where have you gone
Eb                                  Cm           F
       I'm getting tired and I need someone to rely... on.....

Bb                     Dm/A
      I came across               a fallen tree
Cm                               F4        F
      I felt the branches of it looking at me
Bb                       Dm/A
      Is this the place            we used to love
Cm                                      F4      F
      Is this the place that I've been dreaming of

Gm                      Dm
       Oh simple thing        where have you gone
Eb                                  Cm           F
       I'm getting tired and I need someone to rely on

Cm                       Bb
       And if you have a minute why don't we go
Cm                   Bb
       Talk about it somewhere only we know
Cm                       Bb
       This could be the end of everything
Eb         Ebmaj7   F               Ebmaj7
So why don't we go somewhere only we know
 F                Eb  Bb
Somewhere only we  know

Gm   Dm   Fm   Cm
Am   Em   Bb   D

Gm                      Dm
       Oh simple thing        where have you gone
Eb                                  Cm           F  D
       I'm getting tired and I need someone to rely on
Gm                      Dm
       So tell me when        you're gonna let me in
Eb                                  Cm             F
       I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

Cm                      Bb/D
       And if you have a minute why don't we go
Cm                   Bb/D
       Talk about it somewhere only we know
Cm                              Bb/D
       'Cause this could be the end of everything
Eb
So why don't we go
 F             D   Gm    Gm
Somewhere only we know
Eb             F  Ebmaj7    Bb
Somewhere only we  know
