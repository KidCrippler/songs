A  A  A  A

          A
When the night has come
F#m
   And the land is dark
         D          E                 A   A
And the moon is the only light we'll see
                           F#m
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
         D            E            A
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

    A
So darlin', darlin', stand by me
    F#m
Oh stand by me
     D   E            A
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

        A
If the sky that we look upon
F#m
   Should tumble and fall
         D                 E             A   A
All the mountains should crumble to the sea
         A                          F#m
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't   shed a tear
         D            E              A
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

     A
And darlin', darlin', stand by me
    F#m
Oh stand by me
       D       E            A            A
Woah stand now, stand by me, stand by me

A  A  F#m  F#m  D  E
A  A  F#m  F#m  D  E

A
  And darlin', darlin', stand by me
    F#m
Oh stand by me
       D               E            A
Woah stand now, stand by me, stand by me

                                       A
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
    F#m
Oh stand by me
      D              E              A
Woah stand now, oh stand, stand by me
