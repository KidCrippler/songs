(Em   G   C9   D) x 2

                     Em            G    C9    D
Just have a little         patience
                          Em     G     C9     D
I'm still hurting from a        love I lost
                      Em    G    C9    D
I'm feeling your frustration
                         Em      G         C9     D
That any minute all the         pain will stop

            C9
Just hold        me close
        G/B                      C9
Inside        your arms tonight
                         A
Don't be to hard on my emotions

       Em     C9     G    D
'Cause I
         Em     C9    G      D
Need ti       -         me
            Em            C9
My heart is numb, has no feeling
    G                 D
So while I'm still healing
      Em     C9     G    D
Just try

                    Em             G    C9     D
And have a little          patience
                      Em    G     C9     D
I really wanna start       over  again
                       Em      G   C9    D
I know you wanna be my      salvation
                    Em      G      C9    D
The one that I can        always depend

           C9                               G/B
I'll try        to be strong, believe me
                        C9
I'm trying to move on
                           A
It's complicated but understand me

       Em     C9     G    D
'Cause I

Need ti       -         me
            Em            C9
My heart is numb, has no feeling
    G                 D
So while I'm still healing
