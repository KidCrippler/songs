Flying Without Wings - Westlife
Lyrics and Music: Wayne Anthony Hector, Steven McCutcheon

                             G
Everybody's looking for that something
                            Em
One thing that makes it all complete
                                 C
You'll find it in the strangest places
                          D
Places you never knew it could be
                             G
Some find it in the face of their children
                       Em
Some find it in their lover's eyes
                         C
Who can deny the joy it brings
                                D
When you've found that special thing
                      G
You're flying without wings

                            G
Some find it sharing every morning
                 /F#   Em
Some in their solitary lives
                               C        D/C      C
You'll find it in the words of others
                           D
A simple line can make you laugh or cry
                               G          C/G      G
You'll find it in the deepest friendship
                     /F#    Em
The kind you cherish    all your life
                              C
And when you know how much it means
                           D
You've found that special thing
                      G
You're flying without wings
 
           C               D
So, impossible as they may seem
              Em        D/F#   G
You've got to fight for every dream
                 C                     Cm
'Cause who's to know which one you let go
                       D
Would have made you complete
 
                              G
Well, for me it's waking up beside you
                     /F#     Em
To watch the sunrise     on your face
                         C           D/C       C
To know that I can say I love you
                   D          C/D        D
In any given time or place

                             G
It's little things that only I know
                             Em
Those are the things that make you mine
                             C
And it's like flying without wings
                          D
'Cause you're my special thing
                   G
I'm flying without wings
 
                               C
And you're the place my life begins
                       D
And you'll be where it ends
                   C
I'm flying without wings
                        D
And that's the joy you bring
                   G
I'm flying without wings
