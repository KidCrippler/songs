Wake Me Up Before You Go Go - Wham!
Lyrics and Music: George Michael

 C 
Jitterbug [] [] [] (x4)

             C
You put the boom boom into my heart
            Dm                       C
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts
 C
Jitterbug into my brain
       Dm                      C
Goes a bang-bang-bang 'til my feet do the same

    Dm
But something's bugging you
Em
Something ain't right
    F                       Em
My best friend told me what you did last night
Dm               Em
Left me sleepin' in my bed
F                       G
I was dreaming, but I should have been with you instead []

        C
Wake me up before you go-go 
               Dm7               C
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
        C
Wake me up before you go-go
                Dm7                        C
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
        C
Wake me up before you go-go
                Dm7               C
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
        C
Wake me up before you go-go
Dm7               C   Dm7/C   C   C
Take me dancing tonight
                  C   Dm7/C   C   C
I wanna hit that high

              C
You take the grey skies out of my way
             Dm                       C
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
           C
Turned a bright spark into a flame
   Dm                      C
My beats per minute never been the same

        Dm              Em
'Cause you're my lady, I'm your fool
    F                  Em
It makes me crazy when you act so cruel
Dm             Em
Come on, baby, let's not fight
  F               G
We'll go dancing, everything will be all right []

        C
Wake me up before you go-go 
               Dm7               C
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo

Wake me up before you go-go
                Dm7                        C

Dm7              Em7
Cuddle up, baby, move in tight
 F               Em7
We'll go dancing tomorrow night
     Dm7                      Em7
It's cold out there, but it's warm in bed
  F              G                  C   C   Dm7   C
They can dance, we'll stay home instead
