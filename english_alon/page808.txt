Coldplay - Adventure of a lifetime


{Intro}

Dm  G  Am  Am   x4

{Verse}
 
Dm                G                Am
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
                       Am/E   Am/C
Everything you want's a dream away
Dm        G             Am
We are legends, every day
                        Am/E   Am/C
That's what she told me
Dm                G              Am
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
                       Am/E   Am/C
Everything you want to dream away
Dm             G                Am
Under this pressure, under this weight
                   Am/E   Am/C
We are diamonds

{Chorus}

            Dm
I feel my heart beating
G            Am
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Am/E  Am/C  Dm
I feel my heart beating
G                Am
Oh, you make me feel
          Am/E   Am/C
Like I'm alive again
Dm    G    Am    Am  Am/E   Am/C
                   Alive again
Dm    G               Am            Am/E   Am/C
      Oh you make me feel like I'm alive again

{Verse}

Dm              G               Am
Said I can't go on, not in this way
                       Am/E   Am/C
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Dm             G               Am
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
                Am/E   Am/C
Oh, we are omen

{Chorus}

            Dm
I feel my heart beating
G            Am
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Am/E  Am/C    Dm
and I feel my heart beating
G                Am
Oh, you make me feel
Am/E   Am/C
That kind of love again
Dm    G    Am    Am  Am/E   Am/C
                   Alive again
Dm    G               Am            Am/E   Am/C
      Oh you make me feel like I'm alive again

{Instrumental}

Dm   G    Am    Am

{Bridge}

Dm              G             Am
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
                         Am/G
Everything you want's a dream away
Dm            G                  Am
Under this pressure, under this weight
 
We are diamonds taking shape
Em
We are diamonds taking shape

{Interlude}

Dm  G  Am  Am   x2
(woohoo)

{Chorus}

         Dm             G
If we've only got this life
        Am
This adventure, oh then I
  Am/E Am/C   Dm             G
And if we've only got this life
           Am
You get me through
Am/E Am/C    Dm            G
and if we've only got this life
             Am
Then this adventure, oh then I
                     Dm         G         Am
Want to share it with you, with you, with you
               Am/E   Am/C
I said, oh, say oh

{Outro}

Dm  G  Am  Am   x3
(woohoo)
