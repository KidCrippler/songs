Lyrics and Music: Max Martin and Andreas Carlsson

(Em  Em  C  G) x 2

    Em     C  G
You are my fire
    Em    C  G
The one desire
  Em         C  G
Believe when I say
Em          D   G
I want it that way

    Em      C   G      Em
But we are two worlds apart
       C     G      Em
Can't reach to your heart
      C   G
When you say
     Em          D   G
That I want it that way

         C
Tell me why
                     D   Em
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
         C
Tell me why
                    D   Em
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
         C
Tell me why
               D        G
I never wanna hear you say
Em          D   G
I want it that way

   Em     C  G
Am I your fire
     Em    C  G
Your one desire
       Em        C   G
Yes I know it's too late
    Em          D   G
But I want it that way

         C
Tell me why
                     D   Em
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
         C
Tell me why
                    D   Em
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
         C
Tell me why
               D        G
I never wanna hear you say
Em          B
I want it that way

Em                        G/D 
Now I can see that we're falling apart
          C                  Am    D
From the way that it used to be, yeah
   Em                     G/D
No matter the distance, I want you to know
      C                   G - D -
That deep down inside of me...

    C      D  Em
You are my fire
    C     D  Em
The one desire
   Cmaj7              G            Em  [A]
You are, you are, you are, you are
