Don't Stop Me Now - Queen
Lyrics and Music: Freddie Mercury

{Piano Verse}
   F                      Am          Dm
Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time
       Gm  C7         F         F7             Bb
I feel alive and the world I'll turn in inside out, yeah
     Gm7               D7
I'm floating around in ecstasy
   Gm     F   C  Gm
So don't stop me now
Gm     F   C
Don't stop me
           Gm7                 C7
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time

        F                                Am
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
       Dm                Gm           C7
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
       F                 Am             Dm
I'm a racing car passing by like lady Godiva
          Gm       C7                     F
I'm gonna go go go    There's no stopping me

    F7                   Bb
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
    Gm7
Two hundred degrees
                D7                   Gm
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
     D7                        Gm
I'm travelling at the speed of light
              Bb/G  /A    /Bb     /B  C7
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

 F     Gm  Am Dm
Don't stop me now
                  Gm7
I'm having such a good time
    C7
I'm having a ball
 F     Gm  Am Dm
Don't stop me now
                    Gm7
If you wanna have a good time

Don't stop me now (yes I'm having a good time)

I don't want to stop at all... yeah!

       F                       Am
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
        Dm
On a collision course
       Gm             C7
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
       F                     Am
I'm a sex machine ready to reload
        Dm
Like an atom bomb about to
Gm       C7          F
Oh oh oh    oh oh explode

    F7                   Bb
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
    Gm7
Two hundred degrees
                D7                   Gm
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
     D7                        Gm
I'm travelling at the speed of light
              Bb/G  /A    /Bb   /B  C7
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

{Drums only}
Don't stop me, Don't stop me, Don't stop me
Hey hey hey!
Don't stop me, Don't stop me
Ooh ooh ooh (I like it)
Don't stop me, Don't stop me
