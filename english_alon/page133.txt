A   Amaj7/F#   Bm   E
A   Amaj7/F#   Bm   E

A                 Amaj7/F#
   I walked across      an empty land
Bm                              E
   I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
A                  Amaj7/F#
   I felt the earth        beneath my feet
Bm                          E
   Sat by the river and it made me complete

F#m               C#m
   Oh simple thing    where have you gone
D                                            E               
   I'm getting old and i need something to rely on
F#m                C#m
   So tell me when     you're gonna let me in
D                                               E
   I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

A               Amaj7/F#
   I came across        a fallen tree
Bm                            E
   I felt the branches of it looking at me
A                   Amaj7/F#
   Is this the place        we used to love
Bm                                    E
   Is this the place that I've been dreaming of

F#m               C#m
   Oh simple thing    where have you gone
D                                            E               
   I'm getting old and i need something to rely on
F#m                C#m
   So tell me when     you're gonna let me in
D                                               E
   I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

Bm                    A                E
   And if you have a minute why don't we go
Bm                A              E     
   Talk about it somewhere only we know
Bm                   A             E
   This could be the end of everything
 D                C#m/E            A
So why don't we go somewhere only we know
D  A/E                D
  Somewhere only we know

F#m               C#m
   Oh simple thing    where have you gone
D                                            E               
   I'm getting old and i need something to rely on
F#m                C#m
   So tell me when     you're gonna let me in
D                                               E
   I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

Bm                    A                E
   And if you have a minute why don't we go
Bm                A              E     
   Talk about it somewhere only we know
Bm                   A             E
   This could be the end of everything
 D
So why don't we go
              E
So why don't we go

(Bm   Bm   A   E) x 2

Bm                   A             E
   This could be the end of everything
D                 C#m/E            A
So why don't we go somewhere only we know
D  A/E                D
  Somewhere only we know
 E              D    A  
Somewhere only we know
