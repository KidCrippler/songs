A   /Ab   Bm7   E4  -  E  -
A   /Ab   Bm7   E4  -  E  -

A                     C#m/Ab
      I walked across             an empty land
Bm                                E4          E
      I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
A                      C#m/Ab
      I felt the earth             beneath my feet
Bm                            E4          E
      Sat by the river and it made me complete

F#m                    C#m
       Oh simple thing        where have you gone
D                                 Bm/D           E
       I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
F#m                    C#m
       So tell me when        you're gonna let me in
D                                   Bm/D            E
       I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

A                    C#m/Ab
      I came across               a fallen tree
Bm                              E4         E
      I felt the branches of it looking at me
A                       C#m/Ab
      Is this the place            we used to love
Bm                                     E4       E
      Is this the place that I've been dreaming of

F#m                    C#m
       Oh simple thing        where have you gone
D                                 Bm/D           E
       I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
F#m                    C#m
       So tell me when        you're gonna let me in
D                                   Bm/D            E
       I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

Bm7                      A/C#             /E
       And if you have a minute why don't we go
Bm7                  A/C#           /E
       Talk about it somewhere only we know
Bm7                      A/C#         /E
       This could be the end of everything
Bm/D                 E           Asus2
 So why don't we go somewhere only we know
[Bm/D]    C#m/E               Bm/D     C#m/E       -  E    -
          Somewhere only we know

F#m                    C#m
       Oh simple thing        where have you gone
D                                 Bm/D           E
       I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
F#m                    C#m
       So tell me when        you're gonna let me in
D                                   Bm/D            E
       I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

Bm7                      A/C#             /E
       And if you have a minute why don't we go
Bm7                  A/C#           /E
       Talk about it somewhere only we know
Bm7                      A/C#         /E
       This could be the end of everything
D
So why don't we go
              E
So why don't we go

(Bm7   Bm7   A/C#   E) x 2

Bm7                      A/C#         /E
       This could be the end of everything
Bm/D               C#m/E          Asus2
 So why don't we go somewhere only we know
[Bm/D]    C#m/E               Bm/D
          Somewhere only we know
C#m/E         Bm/D    D   A
Somewhere only we   know
