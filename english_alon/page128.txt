Total Eclipse of The Heart - Bonnie Tyler
Lyrics and Music: Jim Steinman

Am   Am

 Am                                       G
(Turn around) Every now and then I get a little bit lonely
and you're never coming round
 Am                                       G
(Turn around) Every now and then I get a little bit tired
                                 C  -->
of listening to the sound of my tears
-->  C                                      Bb
   (Turn around) Every now and then I get a little bit nervous
                                          C  -->
that the best of all the years have gone by
-->  C                                      Bb
   (Turn around) Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
                                Eb  -->
and then I see the look in your eyes
--> Eb            Ab                                    Eb  -->
   (Turn around, bright eyes) Every now and the I fall apart
--> Eb            Ab                                     G
   (Turn around, bright eyes) Every now and the I fall apart

       Em              C            D                 G
And I need you now, tonight, and I need you more than ever
           Em            C              D            G
And if you only hold me tight we'll be holding on forever
          Em                 C                  D                 
And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong
   C                           D
Together we can take it to the end of the line
     Em                          A
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
   G                            D
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
      Em                          A
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
                    G/B       D/A           G/B     C
I really need you tonight, forever's gonna start tonight
   D                     G   -->
Forever's gonna start tonight

--> G                      Em
    Once upon a time I was falling in love but
 B                     C    C/D
now I'm only falling apart
C - G/B -      Am
       There's nothing I can do
   D                    G    Em   C   D
a total eclipse of the heart
G                          Em
Once upon a time there was light in my life
    Bm                            C
but now there's only love in the dark
C - G/B -  Am                    D                    G    Em   C   D   G  G
           Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart

Am   G   Am   G
C   Bb   C   Bb

Eb            Ab                                     Eb -->
(Turn around, bright eyes) Every now and the I fall apart
--> Eb            Ab                                     G
   (Turn around, bright eyes) Every now and the I fall apart

       Em              C            D                 G
And I need you now, tonight, and I need you more than ever
           Em            C              D            G
And if you only hold me tight we'll be holding on forever
          Em                 C                  D                 
And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong
   C                           D
Together we can take it to the end of the line
     Em                          A
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
   G                            D
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
      Em                          A                 A
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
                    G/B       D/A           G/B     C
I really need you tonight, forever's gonna start tonight
   D                     G   -->
Forever's gonna start tonight

--> G                      Em
    Once upon a time I was falling in love but
 B                     C    C/D
now I'm only falling apart
C - G/B -  Am                    D                    G    Em   C
           Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart
   D                    G    Em   C
A total eclipse of the heart
   D                    G
A total eclipse of the heart
