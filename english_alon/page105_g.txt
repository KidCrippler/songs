Wake Me Up Before You Go Go - Wham!
Lyrics and Music: George Michael

 G 
Jitterbug [] [] [] (x4)

             G
You put the boom boom into my heart
            Am                       G
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts
 G
Jitterbug into my brain
       Am                      G
Goes a bang-bang-bang 'til my feet do the same

    Am
But something's bugging you
Bm
Something ain't right
    C                       Bm
My best friend told me what you did last night
Am               Bm
Left me sleepin' in my bed
C                       D
I was dreaming, but I should have been with you instead []

        G
Wake me up before you go-go 
               Am7               G
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
        G
Wake me up before you go-go
                Am7                        G
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
        G
Wake me up before you go-go
                Am7               G
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
        G
Wake me up before you go-go
Am7               G   Am7/G   G   G
Take me dancing tonight
                  G   Am7/G   G   G
I wanna hit that high

              G
You take the grey skies out of my way
             Am                       G
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
           G
Turned a bright spark into a flame
   Am                      G
My beats per minute never been the same

        Am              Bm
'Cause you're my lady, I'm your fool
    C                  Bm
It makes me crazy when you act so cruel
Am             Bm
Gome on, baby, let's not fight
  C               D
We'll go dancing, everything will be all right []

        G
Wake me up before you go-go 
               Am7               G
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo

Wake me up before you go-go
                Am7                        G
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high

Wake me up before you go-go
