Lyrics and Music: The Rembrandts

A   A   A   A

A                                            G
  So no one told you life was gonna be this way
A                                                      C#m
  Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A
G                  Bm               A 
  It's like you're always stuck in second gear
         G                D                   E       
When it hasn't been your day your week or month or even your year, but

A           D          E
  I'll be there for you (when the rain starts to pour)
A           D          E
  I'll be there for you (like I've been there before)
A           D          E                           G
  I'll be there for you ('cause your there for me too)

A                                                G
  You're still in bed at Ten, and work began at Eight
A                                                      C#m
  You've burnt your breakfast so far things are going great
G             Bm                     A
  your mother warned you there'd be days like these 
         G                D                  E
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees, but

A           D          E
  I'll be there for you (when the rain starts to pour)
A           D          E
  I'll be there for you (like I've been there before)
A           D          E                           G    A
  I'll be there for you ('cause your there for me too)

D
  No one could ever know me
D
  No one could ever see me 
F#m
   Sometimes the only one who knows what it's like to be me
Bm
   Someone to face the day with
D/A
   Make it through all the mess with
G              Gmaj7/F#   
   Someone I'll always laugh with
E                  D         E        F#m  D  E
   Even under the worst I'm best with you,   yeah

 A   D   E   E
F#m F#m  D   E
 A   D   E   E

G                  Bm               A 
  It's like you're always stuck in second gear
         G                D                   E                    E
When it hasn't been your day your week or month or even your year

A           D          E
  I'll be there for you (when the rain starts to pour)
A           D          E
  I'll be there for you (like I've been there before)
A           D          E                           G
  I'll be there for you ('cause your there for me too)
A           D          E
  I'll be there for you
A           D          E
  I'll be there for you
A           D          E                           G
  I'll be there for you ('cause your there for me too)
