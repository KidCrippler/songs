She's Like The Wind - Patrick Swayze
Lyrics and Music: Patrick Swayze and Stacy Widelitz

  C       C     Em   Em
Cmaj7   Cmaj7   Em   Em

Cmaj7                            Em
She's like the wind, through my tree
Cmaj7                        Em
 She rides the night next to me
    Cmaj7
She leads me through moonlight
                         Em
Only to burn me with the sun
      Cmaj7
She's taken my heart
                                Em
But she doesn't know what she's done

            Am7
I feel her breath in my face
          Bm7
Her body close to me
      Am7
Can't look in her eyes
      Bm7           D
She's out of my league

G          Bm/F#     Em7
    Just a fool to believe
       G/D          Cmaj7
I have anything she needs
               Cmaj7   --->
She's like the wind

--->   Cmaj7   Cmaj7   Em   Em
       Cmaj7   Cmaj7   Em   Em

  Cmaj7                        Em
I look in the mirror and all I see
     Cmaj7                      Em
Is a young old man with only a dream
          Cmaj7
Am I just fooling myself
                     Em
That she'll stop the pain?
Cmaj7                        Em
Living without her, I'd go insane!

            Am7
I feel her breath in my face
          Bm7
Her body close to me
      Am7
Can't look in her eyes
      Bm7           D
She's out of my league

G          Bm/F#     Em7
    Just a fool to believe
       G/D          Cmaj7
I have anything she needs
               Cmaj7   --->
She's like the wind

             Am7
I feel your breath in my face
           Bm7
Your body close to me

Can't look in your eyes
       Bm7           D
You're out of my league

G           Bm/F#     Em7           G/D       Cmaj7

She's like the wind
