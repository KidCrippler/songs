The Winner Takes it All - ABBA
Lyrics and Music: Benny Anderson and Bjoern Ulvaeus

{Only piano}
F  /A - Dm  /F# - Gm  C7
F  /A - Dm  /F# - Gm  C7

               F
I don't wanna talk
                   C/E
About things we've gone through
                    Gm
Though it's hurting me
              C7
Now it's history
             F
I've played all my cards
                       C/E
And that's what you've done too
                Gm
Nothing more to say
               C7
No more ace to play

{Bass joins}
                    F
The winner takes it all
    /A                Dm
The loser's standing small
  /F#           Gm
Beside the victory
                C7
That's her destiny

{Rest of the band joins}
              F
I was in your arms
             C/E
Thinking I belonged there
                   Gm
I figured it made sense
               C7
Building me a fence
             F
Building me a home
                  C/E
Thinking I'd be strong there
             Gm
But I was a fool
               C7
Playing by the rules

                     F
The gods may throw a dice
      /A         Dm
Their minds as cold as ice
    /F#     Gm
And someone way down here
          C7
Loses someone dear
                F
The winner takes it all
    /A           Dm
The loser has to fall
     /F#              Gm
It's simple and it's plain
             C7
Why should I complain?

            F 
But tell me  does she kiss
              C/E
Like I used to kiss you?
                 Gm
Does it feel the same
                  C7
When she calls your name?
            F
Somewhere deep inside
               C/E
You must know I miss you
              Gm
But what can I say?
               C7
Rules must be obeyed

               F
The judges will decide
    /A       Dm
The likes of me abide
    /F#           Gm
Spectators of the show
          C7
Always staying low
                F
The game is on again
  /A         Dm
A lover or a friend
 /F#              Gm
A big thing or a small
                    C7   C7
The winner takes it all

{Quiet, just piano}
               F
I don't wanna talk
                C/E
If it makes you feel sad
            Gm
And I understand
                    C7
You've come to shake my hand
        F
I apologize
                C/E
If it makes you feel bad
              Gm
Seeing me so tense
          C7
No self-confidence (But you see)

                    F
The winner takes it all
     /A     Dm
   /F#              Gm
The winner takes it all
       C7

F                
          So the winner
/A    Dm
          takes it all
/F#   Gm            
          And the the loser
C7
          has to fall
F
          Throw a dice
/A   Dm
          cold as ice
/F#   Gm
          Way down here
C7
          someone dear
F
          Takes it all
/A   Dm
          has to fall
/F#   Gm
          It seems plain...
C7
