The Winner Takes it All - ABBA
Lyrics and Music: Benny Anderson and Bjoern Ulvaeus

F  /A - Dm  /F# - Gm  C7
F  /A - Dm  /F# - Gm  C7

               F
I don't wanna talk
                   C/E
About things we've gone through
                    Gm
Though it's hurting me
              C7
Now it's history
             F
I've played all my cards
                       C/E
And that's what you've done too
                Gm
Nothing more to say
               C7
No more ace to play

                    F
The winner takes it all
                      Dm
The loser's standing small
                Gm
Beside the victory
                C7
That's her destiny

              F
I was in your arms
             C/E
Thinking I belonged there
                   Gm
I figured it made sense
               C7
Building me a fence
             F
Building me a home
                  C/E
Thinking I'd be strong there
             Gm
But I was a fool
               C7
Playing by the rules

                    F
The gods may throw a dice
               Dm
Their minds as cold as ice
            Gm
And someone way down here
          C7
Loses someone dear
                F
The winner takes it all
                 Dm
The loser has to fall
                    Gm
It's simple and it's plain
             C7
Why should I complain?

            F 
But tell me  does she kiss
              C/E
Like I used to kiss you?
                 Gm
Does it feel the same
                  C7
When she calls your name?
            F
Somewhere deep inside
               C/E
You must know I miss you
              Gm
But what can I say?
               C7
Rules must be obeyed

               F
The judges will decide
             Dm
The likes of me abide
                   Gm
Spectators of the show
          C7
Always staying low
              F
The game is on again
             Dm
A lover or a friend
                  Gm
A big thing or a small
                    C7   C7
The winner takes it all

               F
I don't wanna talk
                C/E
If it makes you feel sad
            Gm
And I understand
                    C7
You've come to shake my hand
        F
I apologize
                C/E
If it makes you feel bad
              Gm
Seeing me so tense
          C7
No self-confidence (But you see)

                    F   Dm
The winner takes it all
                Gm       C7
The winner takes it all

F               Dm
  So the winner    takes it all
Gm                  C7
  And the the loser    has to fall
F              Dm
  Throw a dice,  cold as ice
Gm              C7
  Way down here,   someone dear
F              Dm
  Takes it all,   has to fall
Gm                  C7
  It seems plain...
