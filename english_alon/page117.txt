Father and Son - Cat Stevens
Lyrics and Music: Cat Stevens

G  C  G  C  G  C  G  []

          G              D/F#           C              Am7
It's not time to make a change, just relax and take it easy
              G                 Em               Am                 D
You're still young that's your fault, there's so much you have to know
        G           D/F#          C            Am7
Find a girl, settle down, if you want, you can marry
        G        Em             Am    Am7 - D
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
      G                 D/F#         C                Am7
I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy
       G                Em             Am       Am7 - D
To be calm when you've found something going on
               G            D/F#               C                 Am7
But take your time, think a lot, why, think of everything you've got
              G                 Em              D         G  C  G  C
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

        G           Bm                   C           Am7
How can I try to explain? 'cause when I do he turns away again
     G               Em              Am   Am7 - D
It's always been the same, same old story
          G             Bm         C             Am7
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
               G          Em          D           G
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away
    D     C       G
I know I have to go

G    D/F# C    Am7
G    Em   Am Am7 - D

          G              D/F#           C              Am7
It's not time to make a change, just relax and take it easy
              G                  Em               Am                     D
You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to go through
        G           D/F#          C            Am7
Find a girl, settle down, if you want, you can marry
        G        Em             Am    Am7 - D
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy

         G               Bm            C                 Am7
All the times that I've cried, keeping all the things I knew inside
      G             Em          Am       D
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
              G           Bm              C                 Am7
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know, not me
               G          Em          D           G
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away
    D     C       G
I know I have to go
