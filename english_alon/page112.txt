High - Lighthouse Family
Lyrics and Music: Paul Tucker

C  G  Am  F

 C                    G
When you're close to tears remember
Am             F
Some day it'll all be over
C                    G     Am   F
One day we're gonna get so high
     C                   G       
And though it's darker than December
Am                 F
What's ahead is a different color
C                    G     Am   F
One day we're gonna get so high

       Gm7
And at     The end of the day
                   Fm7
We'll remember the days when we were close to the edge
Gm7                         Fm7
    And we'll wonder how we made it through
       Gm7          
And at     The end of the day
                   Fm7
We'll remember the way we stayed so close 'til the end
Gm7                        F      G
    We'll remember it was me and you

        C            G    Am            F
'Cause we are gonna be forever you and me
         C               G                  Am     F
You will always keep me flying high in the sky of love

 C                    G
Don't you think it's time you started
Am            F
Doing what we always wanted
C                    G     Am   F
One day we're gonna get so high
       C           G          Am
'Cause even the impossible is easy
         F
When we got each other
C                    G     Am   F
One day we're gonna get so high

       Gm7
And at     The end of the day
                   Fm7
We'll remember the days when we were close to the edge
Gm7                         Fm7
    And we'll wonder how we made it through
       Gm7          
And at     The end of the day
                   Fm7
We'll remember the way we stayed so close 'til the end
Gm7                        F      G
    We'll remember it was me and you

        C            G    Am            F
'Cause we are gonna be forever you and me
         C               G                  Am     F
You will always keep me flying high in the sky of love

C       G         Bb        Am
  High     High       High     High

       Gm7
And at     The end of the day
                   Fm7
We'll remember the days when we were close to the edge
Gm7                         Fm7
    And we'll wonder how we made it through
       Gm7          
And at     The end of the day
                   Fm7
We'll remember the way we stayed so close 'til the end
Gm7                        F      G
    We'll remember it was me and you

        C            G    Am            F
'Cause we are gonna be forever you and me
         C               G                  Am     F
You will always keep me flying high in the sky of love
        C            G    Am            F
'Cause we are gonna be forever you and me
         C               G                  Am     F
You will always keep me flying high in the sky of love
        C            G    Am            F
'Cause we are gonna be forever you and me
         C               G                  Am     F
You will always keep me flying high in the sky of love

C  G  Am  F
