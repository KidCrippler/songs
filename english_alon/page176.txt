Lyrics and Music: Robbie Williams, Guy Chambers, Dino Fekaris, Freddie Perren

Dm x 8

Dm               Gm
Oh, it seemed forever stopped today
         C                               Fmaj7
All the lonely hearts in London caught a plane and flew away
            Dm                              Do
And all the best women are married, all the handsome men are gay
             A
You feel deprived

Dm              Gm
Yeah, are you questioning your size?
            C                               Fmaj7
Is there a tumour in your humour, are there bags under your eyes?
             Dm                           E7/G#
Do you leave dents where you sit, are you getting on a bit?
           Asus4               A
Will you survive, you must survive

             Dm         Bb
When there's no love in town
              F                      A
This new century keeps bringing you down
         Dm              Bb
All the places you have been
          F              A               Dm   Dm     Dm     Dm
Trying to find a love supreme, a love supreme

Dm               Gm
Oh, what are you really looking for?
         C                      Fmaj7
Another partner in your life to abuse and to adore?
      Dm                           E7/G#
Is it lovey dovey stuff, or do you need a bit of rough?
              A
Get on your knees

Dm                  Gm
Yeah, turn down the love songs that you hear
            C                              Fmaj7
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment, That echoes in your ear
       Dm                              E7/G#
Saying love will stop the pain, saying love will kill the fear
        Asus4               A
Do you believe? You must believe

             Dm         Bb
When there's no love in town
              F                      A
This new century keeps bringing you down
         Dm              Bb
All the places you have been
           F              A              Dm    --->
Trying to find a love supreme, a love supreme

{Synth Solo}
--->   Dm       Gm   C   Fmaj7
       Bbmaj7   Gm   A     A

{Rap Part}
Dm   Dm   Dm   Dm

Dm                         Gm
I spy with my little eye, something beginning with ahâ€¦ Got my back up
C
And now she's screaming so I've got to turn the track up
Fmaj7
Sit back and watch the royalties stack up
Bbmaj7
           I know this girl, she likes to switch teams
Do/G#                                                    A
          And I'm a friend but I'm living for a love supreme

{Chorus}
             Dm         Bb
When there's no love in town
              F                      A
This new century keeps bringing you down
         Dm              Bb
All the places you have been
           F              A              Dm
Trying to find a love supreme, a love supreme

Dm                      Bb
Come and live a love supreme
                      F
Don't let it get you down
                     A
Everybody lives for love
Dm                      Bb
Come and live a love supreme
                      F
Don't let it get you down
                     A
Everybody lives for love

{Repeat until Fade Out}
