Wind Of Change - Scorpions
Lyrics and Music: Klaus Meine

F  Dm  F  Dm  Am  Dm - Am - G - C

C                  Dm
  I follow the Moskva
               C
Down to Gorky Park
                 Dm       Am  G
Listening to the wind of change
C                  Dm
  An August summer night
                 C
Soldiers passing by
                 Dm       Am  G
Listening to the wind of change

F  Dm  F  Dm  Am  Dm - Am - G - C

C                      Dm
  The world is closing in
               C
Did you ever think
                     Dm          Am  G  
That we could be so close, like brothers
C                     Dm
  The future's in the air
                     C
I can feel it everywhere
                 Dm       Am  G  G
Blowing with the wind of change

 C    G        Dm            G
Take me to the magic of the moment
       C    G
On a glory night
           Dm            G            Am   F
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
                 G      C   C
In the wind of change

C                    Dm
  Walking down the street
             C
Distant memories
                  Dm     Am  G
Are buried in the past forever
C                  Dm
  I follow the Moskva
               C
Down to Gorky Park
                 Dm      Am   G
Listening to the wind of change

 C    G        Dm            G
Take me to the magic of the moment
       C    G
On a glory night
           Dm            G            Am   F
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
                 G
In the wind of change

Am                            G
  The wind of change blows straight
                  Am
Into the face of time
                            G
Like a stormwind that will ring
                               C
The freedom bell for peace of mind
                   Dm
Let your balalaika sing
                         E   E   E   E
What my guitar wants to say

F - G - E - Am - F - G - Am - Am
F - G - E - Am - Dm - Dm - E - E

 C    G        Dm            G
Take me to the magic of the moment
       C    G
On a glory night
           Dm            G            Am   F
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
                 G     G
In the wind of change

F  Dm  F  Dm  Am  Dm
