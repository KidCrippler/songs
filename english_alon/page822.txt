marron5 - move like jagger




Just Shoot For The Stars
If it Feels Right
Then Aim From My Heart
If you Feel Like
And Take Me Away
Make it Okay
I Swear I'll Behave

You Wanted Control
So We Waited
I Put On a Show
Now I Make it
You Said I'm a Kid
My Ego is Big
I Don't Give a Shit

{Chorus}
And it Goes Like This
Take Me By The Tongue
And I'll Know You
Kiss Me Till You're Drunk
And I'll Show You All

The Moves Like Jagger
I've Got The Moves Like Jagger
I've Got The Moves Like Jagger

I Don't Need To Try To Control You
Look Into My Eyes and I'll Own You
With Them Moves Like Jagger
I've Got The Moves Like Jagger
I've Got The Moves Like Jagger

{Verse 3}
Maybe It's Hard
When You Feel Like
You're Broken And Scarred
Nothing Feels Right
But When You're With Me
I'll Make You Believe
That I've Got The Key (Oh! )

So Get In The Car
We Can Ride it
Wherever You Want
Get Inside it
And You Want to Steer
But I'm Shifting Gears
I'll Take it From Here

{Chorus}
And it Goes Like This
Take Me By The Tongue
And I'll Know You
Kiss Me Till You're Drunk
And I'll Show You All

The Moves Like Jagger
I've Got The Moves Like Jagger
I've Got The Moves Like Jagger

I Don't Need To Try To Control You
Look Into My Eyes and I'll Own You
With Them Moves Like Jagger
I've Got The Moves Like Jagger
I've Got The Moves Like Jagger

{Chistina's Verse}
You Wanna Know
How To Make Me Smile
Take Control
Own Me Just For The Night
And If I Share My Secret
You're Gonna Have To Keep it
Nobody Else Can See This

So Watch An Learn
I Won't Show You Twice
Head To Toe
Oooh Baby Rub Me Right

But If I Share My Secret
You're Gonna Have To Keep it
Nobody Else Can See This

{Chorus}
And it Goes Like This
Take Me By The Tongue
And I'll Know You
Kiss Me Till You're Drunk
And I'll Show You All

The Moves Like Jagger
I've Got The Moves Like Jagger
I've Got The Moves Like Jagger

I Don't Need To Try To Control You
Look Into My Eyes and I'll Own You
With Them Moves Like Jagger
I've Got The Moves Like Jagger
I've Got The Moves Like Jagger
