Always - Bon Jovi
Lyrics and Music: Jon Bon Jovi

C  F  Am - G - F  F

Am                         G
   This Romeo is bleeding,   but you can't see his blood
F                                             Em
   It’s nothing but some feelings,  that this old dog kicked up
Am                                                G
   It’s been raining since you left me, now I'm drowning in the flood
F                                              Em             F   G
   You see I've always been a fighter, but without you I give u - p
Am                                         G
   Now I can't sing a love song, like the way it's meant to be
         F                                    G                F   G
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore, but baby, that's just m - e


      C       G          Dm   Am   G
Yeah, I will love you, baby,   always
    C                G           F   Am G  
And I'll be there forever and a day  always
C
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
          G
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme          
            F
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
          G         F G    Am     F
And I'll love you,  alwa - ys

         Am
Now your pictures that you left behind
          G
Are just memories of a different life
           F
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
         Em                 F       G
One that made you, have to say goodbye
         Am
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
G
  Touch your lips, to hold you near
          F
When you say your prayers, try to understand
     Em                  F      G
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
         Am
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
         G
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
          F
I'll wish I was him `cause those words are mine
    G                  F       G
To say to you till the end of time

    C       G          Dm   Am   G
And I will love you, baby,   always
    C                G           F   Am G  
And I'll be there forever and a day  always

Bb                   Eb          F        Bb
   If you told me to cry for you, I could
                    Eb       F      Gm
If you told me to die for you, I would
       Gm/F        Eb
Take a look at my face
                          F
There’s no price I won't pay, to say these words to you

C  G  Dm  Am - G -
C  G  F   G

             F
Well, there ain't no luck, in these loaded dice
     G
But baby if you give me just one more try
        F
We can pack up our old dreams and our old lives
          [G]                           [F]
We’ll find a place where the sun still shines

      C       G          Dm   Am   G
Yeah, I will love you, baby,   always
    C                G           F   Am G  
And I'll be there forever and a day  always
C
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
          G
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme          
            F
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
          G
And I'll love you
F G    (C   G   Am  -  C  -  F) x 4
