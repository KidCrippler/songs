  Gm                                    Cm7
Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
  Eb                                Bb
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
     Gm                              Cm7
Give in this time and show me some affection
      Eb                               Bb
We're going for those pleasures in the night

          Am7                  Gm          Dm
I want to love you, feel you, wrap myself around you
            Am7                      Gm
I want to squeeze you, please you, I just can't get enough
           Cm7       Dm7              F
And if you move real slow I'll let it go

         Gm                      Eb
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
                       F                Gm
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
         Gm                      Eb
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
                       F
And I know, I know, I know, I know
         Gm
I know I want you

    Gm                          Cm7
We shouldn’t even think about tomorrow
      Eb                              Bb
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
      Gm                               Cm7
We’ll have a good time baby, don’t you worry
       Eb                                          Bb
And if we’re still playing ‘round, boy that’s just fine

            Gm                   Eb
Let’s get excited, we just can’t hide it
Eb                     F                Gm
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
         Gm                      Eb
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
                        F
And I know, I know, I know, I know
         Gm
I know I want you, want you
