Alone - Heart
Lyrics and Music: Steinberg E. William, Kelly F. Thomas

Dm   Bb   C   C7/Bb
Dm   Bb   C   A/C#

Dm            Bb               C        
   I hear the ticking of the clock
    C7/Bb           Dm          Bb   C   A/C#
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark
Dm           Bb              C
   I wonder where you are tonight
   C7/Bb          Dm          Bb   C   A/C#
No answer on your telephone
        Bb           F/A       Bb/G      F
And the night goes by so very slow
     Bb                 F/A   Bb/G   C4  -  C   F  F  F  F
Oh I hope that it won't end, though...      Alone

Gm       Eb     Bb          F       Gm
    Till now, I always got by on my own
Eb             Bb          F
I never really cared until I met you
Gm   Eb             Bb            F
        And now it chills me to the bone
Bb/D     Eb        F
How do I get you alone
Bb/D     Eb        F   F   F - Fmaj7 -
How do I get you alone

Dm                 Bb               C
    You don't know how long I have wanted
   C7/Bb               Dm       Bb   C   A/C#
to touch your lips and hold you tight
Dm                 Bb               C
    You don't know how long I have waited
  C7/Bb         Dm         Bb     C    A/C#
and I was gonna tell you tonight
        Bb        F/A      Bb/G    F
But the secret is still my own
       Bb              F/A     Bb/G    C4  -  C   F  F  F  F
And my love for you is still unknown...       Alone

Gm  -  Eb    Bb  -  F
Gm  -  Eb    Bb  -  F
       Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
 
Gm       Eb     Bb          F       Gm
    Till now, I always got by on my own
Eb             Bb          F
I never really cared until I met you
Gm   Eb             Bb            F
        And now it chills me to the bone
Bb/D     Eb        F
How do I get you alone
Bb/D     Eb        F   F
How do I get you alone

Eb    Bb/D   Cm    Bb
F/A   F/G    F   F7/Eb

Bb/D     Eb        F
How do I get you alone
Bb/D     Eb        F
How do I get you alone
 Bb/D   Eb   F
Alone
 Bb/D   Eb   F   F   F - Fmaj7 -
Alone
