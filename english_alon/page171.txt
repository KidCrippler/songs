In My Life - The Beatles
Lyrics and Music: John Lennon, Paul McCartney

A   A   E   E   A   A   E   E

            A    E      F#m     A7/G
There are places I'll remember
       D  Dm         A
All my life  though some have changed
        A     E      F#m     A7/G
Some forever not for better
          D  Dm      A
Some have gone  and some remain

          F#m               D
All these places had their moments
      G                     A
With lovers and friends I still can recall
         F#m               B7
Some are dead and some are living
   Dm            A
In my life I've loved them all

A   A   E   E

       A           E         F#m     A7/G
But of all these friends and lovers
         D   Dm     A
There is no one compares with you
           A        E         F#m      A7/G
And these memories lose their meaning
         D      Dm       A
When I think of love as something new

          F#m                    D
Though I know I'll never lose affection
     G                      A
For people and things that went before
   F#m                            B7
I know I'll often stop and think about them
   Dm         A
In my life I love you more

{Piano Solo}
A   E   F#m   A7/G   D   Dm   A   A
A   E   F#m   A7/G   D   Dm   A   A

          F#m                    D
Though I know I'll never lose affection
     G                      A
For people and things that went before
   F#m                            B7
I know I'll often stop and think about them
   Dm         A
In my life I love you more

A   A   E   E

   [Dm7]                   A    -->
In   my   life I love you more
