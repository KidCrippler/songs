Lyrics and Music: Bjorklund Amund, Lind Espen

{Brass and Guitar}
Am   Dm   G    C
F    Dm   E7   E7

{Rest Join}
Am             Dm
   My heart is paralyzed
G              C
   My head was oversized
F                Dm                 E7    E7
   I'll take the high road like I should
Am               Dm
   You said it's meant to be
G                 C
   That it's not you, it's me
F                 Dm              E7    E7
   You're leaving now for my own good
            []
That's cool but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

          F
She went down in an airplane
  C
Fried getting suntan
G                   Am              G
   Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
 F                C                 Bm      E7
Help me, help me I'm no good at goodbyes
            F
She met a shark underwater
 C
Fell and no one caught her
G                   Am           G
   I returned everything I ever bought her
 F                C              E7
Help me, help me I'm all out of lies
                    Am  --->
And ways to say you died

{Brass Solo}
--->  Am   Dm   G    C
      F    Dm   E7   E7

Am                 Dm
   My pride still feels the sting
G              C
   You were my everything
F               Dm                E7   E7
   Someday I'll find a love like yours
Am                  Dm
   She'll think I'm Superman
G             C
   Not super minivan
F                Dm               E7   E7
   How could you leave on Yom Kippur
            []
That's cool but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

         F
She was caught in a mudslide
 C
Eaten by a lion
G                     Am            G
   Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
 F                C                 Bm     E7
Help me, help me I'm no good at goodbyes
          F
She dried up in the desert
  C
Drowned in a hot tub
 G                    Am         G
Danced to death at an east side nightclub
 F                C              E7
Help me, help me I'm all out of lies
                    Am   --->
And ways to say you died

I wanna live a thousand lives with you
   F
I wanna be the one your dying to
 G                     F
Love... but you don't want to

That's cool but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say
