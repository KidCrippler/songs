All I Ask - Adele
Lyrics and Music: Adele, Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Christopher Brody Brown

Emaj7   G#m7   A9   B

Emaj7                  G#m7
  I will leave my heart at the door
        A9
I won't say a word
        B
They've all been said before, you know

  Emaj7              G#m7
So why don't we just play pretend
                A9
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
     B               G#     /C
Or scared of having nothing left

      C#m                    E/B
Look, don't get me wrong, I know
                 F#m
There is no tomorrow
F#m7/B
  All I ask is

E             C#7        Fo   F#m
If this is my last night with you
A/B              B7        B/D#    E
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
          C#7     Fo    F#m
Give me a memory I  can use
A/B            B7
Take me by the hand
B/D#     E       B/D#   C#m
while we do what lovers do
           E/G#     F#m7
It matters how this ends
      F#m7/B                 Emaj7
'Cause what if I never love again?

G#m7   A9   B

Emaj7               G#m7
  I don't need your honesty
             A9
It's already in your eyes
        B
and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me

Emaj7             G#m7
  No one knows me like you do
                     A9
and since you're the only one that matters
         B            G#   /C
tell me, who do I run to?

     C#m                    E/B
Now, don't get me wrong, I know
                 F#m
There is no tomorrow
F#m7/B
  All I ask is

E             C#7        Fo   F#m
If this is my last night with you
A/B              B7        B/D#    E
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
          C#7     Fo    F#m
Give me a memory I  can use
A/B            B7
Take me by the hand
B/D#     E       B/D#   C#m
while we do what lovers do
           E/G#     F#m7
It matters how this ends
       A/B                  E/D
'Cause what if I never love again?

                A     G#m    F#m7
Let this be our lesson in    love
                A/B  B7   B/A   B/G#
Let this be the way  we remember us
                   G#7
I don't want to be cruel
/C  /Eb  C#m  -  B/C#    -  A/G#     -
or   vicious
            F#m7
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
F#m7/B     C7sus4
  All I ask is

F             D7         D/F# Gm
If this is my last night with you
Bb/C             C7        C7/E    F
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
          D7      F#o     Gm
Give me a memory I    can use
Bb/C           C7
Take me by the hand
C7/E     F       C7/E   Dm7
while we do what lovers do
           F/A      Gm7
It matters how this ends
       Bb/C            C7sus4    F
'Cause what if I never love...     again
