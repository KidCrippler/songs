[Cm]  -  [Cm]   Ab/C   Cm

[Cm]                                     
This ain't a song
                       [Cm]     -  [Cm]      Ab/C      Cm
for the broken hearted
   Cm
No silent prayer
                Bb     [Cm]     -  [Cm]      Ab/C      Cm
for the faith departed
   Cm                      Bb/C
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd            
             Eb/C
You're gonna hear my voice
        F/C               [] []
When I shout it out loud

        Cm         Ab    
It's my life, it's now or never
Eb                       Bb
       And I ain't gonna live forever
Cm                    Ab              Bb
       I just want to live while I'm alive
Bb/B     Cm
(It's my life)
                    Ab
My heart is like an open highway
Eb                          Bb
       Like Frankie said "I did it my way"
Cm                    Ab              Bb
       I just want to live while I'm alive
      Bb/B   [Cm]     -  [Cm]      Ab/C      Cm
It's   my    life

[Cm]     -  [Cm]      Ab/C      Cm

    [Cm]
And this is for the ones
                           [Cm]     -  [Cm]      Ab/C      Cm
who stood their ground
    Cm
For Tommy and Gina
                 Bb    [Cm]     -  [Cm]      Ab/C      Cm
who never backed down
  Cm                          Bb/C
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Eb/C
Luck ain't even lucky
       F/C                    [] []
Got to make your own breaks

        Cm             Ab    
It's my life, and it's now or never

       I ain't gonna live forever
Cm                    Ab              Bb
       I just want to live while I'm alive

(It's my life)
                    Ab
My heart is like an open highway
Eb                          Bb
       Like Frankie said "I did it my way"
Cm                    Ab              Bb
