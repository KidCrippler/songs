Turn The Lights Back On - Billy Joel
Lyrics and Music: Billy Joel

{Intro}
C   F   G   E  -  E7  -
Am   D/F#   G4  -  G  -  F  -  Em  -

 C               F
Please open the door
            G                            E
Nothing is different, we've been here before
E7           Am
Pacing these halls
          D/F#          G4       G   -  F   -  Em    -
Trying to talk over the silence
     C                    F
And pride sticks out its tongue
               G                     E
Laughs at the portrait that we've become
 E7         Am
Stuck in a frame
          D/F#           G4       G   -  F   -  Em    -
Unable to change, I was wrong

     C             F          G
I'm late, but I'm here right now
         E       E7   Am          D/F#     G4  -  G   -
Though I used to be romantic, I forgot somehow
          F    G         C
Time can make      you blind
      F        G            E     E7     Am
But I see you now as we're layin' in the darkness
      D/F#     G4    G                 F      G        C    --->
Did I wait too long       to turn the lights      back on?

--->  C   F   G4  -  G  -  F  -  Em  -

 C                F
Herе, stuck on a hill
          G                        E
Outsiders inside the homе that we built
    E7           Am
The cold settles in
                 D/F#        G4    G    -   F   -
It's been a long winter of indifference
    Em         C                  F
And maybe you love me, maybe you don't
              G                      E
Maybe you'll learn to and maybe you won't
E7          Am                     D/F#   G4       G   -  F   -  Em    -
You've had enough, but I won't give up on you

     C             F          G
I'm late, but I'm here right now
         E        E7       Am            D/F#     G4   -   G    -
And I'm tryin' to find the magic that we lost somehow
      F   G         C
Maybe I       was blind
      F        G            E     E7     Am
But I see you now as we're layin' in the darkness
      D/F#     G4    G             F            G         Am    --->
Did I wait too long       to turn    the lights    back on?

{Piano Solo}
--->  Am   D   G   C
      F   -   Am   -   G4   -   G   -
      F   -   Am   -   G4   -   G   -

     C             F          G
I'm late, but I'm here right now
          E         E7              Am
Is there still time for forgiveness?
          D/F#    G4   -  G  -  F         Em         C
Won't you tell me how?            I can't read your mind
      F        G            E     E7          Am
But I see you now as we're layin' in the darkness
      D/F#     G4    G               F     G      C     F
Did I wait too long     to turn the lights   back on?
                G     E
I'm here right now
         E7         Am    D/F#
Yes, I'm here right now
               G4        G   -  F   -  G    -
Lookin' for forgiveness
      C             F              G
I can see as we're layin' in the darkness
                E     E7         Am
Yeah, as we're layin' in the darkness
      D/F#     G4    -    G    -    F               G          C
Did I wait too long                    to turn the lights back on?
