Listen To Your Heart - Roxette
Lyrics and Music: Per Gessle & Mats Persson

(Am  -  F   G  -  Am) x 3
 Am  -  F   Dm    Dm

Am          F                       G            Am
   I know there's something in the wake of your smile
Am       F                  G           Am
   I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
Am              F                G          Am
   You've built a love but that love falls apart
                     Am     F           Dm
Your little piece of heaven   turns too dark

               Am     F
Listen to your heart
           C           G
When he's calling for you
               Am     F
Listen to your heart
                C             G
There's nothing else you can do
          C                G
I don't know where you're going
    F             C
And I don't know why
                   Am    F
But listen to your heart
      G                 Am  -->
Before you tell him goodbye

Am            F                  G             Am
   Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
Am         F                     G          Am
   The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
Am               F                G           Am
   They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
                 Am      F           Dm
The feeling of belonging    to your dreams

               Am     F
Listen to your heart
           C           G
When he's calling for you
               Am     F
Listen to your heart
                C             G
There's nothing else you can do
          C                G
I don't know where you're going
    F             C
And I don't know why
                   Am    F
But listen to your heart
      G                 Am  -->
Before you tell him goodbye

   And there are voices that want to be heard
Bm
   So much to mention, but you can't find the words
A                           G
   The scent of magic, the beauty that's been
A                       B
   When love was wilder   than the wind

               C#m            A
Listen to your heart (take a listen)
           E           B
When he's calling for you
               C#m            A
Listen to your heart (take a listen)
                E             B
There's nothing else you can do
          E                B
I don't know where you're going
    A             E
And I don't know why
                   C#m    A
But listen to your heart
   B
Before (Ohhhhhhh)

               C#m            A
Listen to your heart (take a listen)
           E           B
When he's calling for you
               C#m            A
Listen to your heart (take a listen)
                E             B
There's nothing else you can do
          E                B
I don't know where you're going
    A             E
And I don't know why
                   C#m    A
But listen to your heart
   B
Before...
                 C#m -->
You tell him goodbye
