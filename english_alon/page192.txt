Lyrics and Music: Bryan Adams and Eliott Kennedy

Dm      F     C                     G
                  When you're gone!

            Dm                  G
I've been wandering around the house all night
C                             C4
Wond'ring what the hell to do
      C     Dm                      G                      C    C4 C
Yeah, I'm trying to concentrate but all I can think of is you
           Dm                         G
Well, the phone don't ring cause my friends ain't home
C                           C4  C
I'm tired of being all alone
         Dm               Bb              G
Got the TV on, cause the radio's playing songs that remind me of you

                 Dm   F
Baby when you're gone
                  C   G
I realize I'm in love
               Dm  F
Days go on and on
                          C  G
And the nights just seem so long
                            Dm   F
Even food don't taste that good
                            C    G
Drink ain't doing what it should
                     Dm   Bb
Things just feel so wrong
                   G
Baby, when you're gone

                  Dm            G
Yeah, I've been driving up and down these streets
C                             C4
Trying to find somewhere to go
           Dm                     G                          C    C4  C
Yeah, I'm lookin' for a familiar face but there's no one I know
    Dm                G                 C                   C4   C
Ah, this is torture, this is pain, it feels like I'm gonna go insane
   Dm                 Bb                     G
I hope you're coming back real soon cause I don't know what to do

                 Dm   F
Baby when you're gone (When you're gone)
                  C   G
I realize I'm in love
               Dm  F
Days go on and on (On and on)
                          C  G
And the nights just seem so long
                            Dm   F
Even food don't taste that good
                            C    G
Drink ain't doing what it should
                     Dm   Bb
Things just feel so wrong
                        G
Yeah, baby, when you're gone
