What You're Made Of - Lucie Silvas
Lyrics and Music: Lucie Silvas, Peter Gordeno, Mike Peden

Em  D  C  C

Em                D                    C
  Just like I predicted, we're at the point of no return
Em           D                 C
  We can go backwards, and no corners have been turned
Em             D            C
  I can't control it, if I sink or if I swim
Em                   D              C
  Cause I chose the waters that I'm in

                           D                  Am
And it makes no difference   who is right or wrong
                           D
I deserve much more than this
Bm                 C
Cause there's only one thing I want

        Em               C
If it's not what you're made of
             G               D
You're not what I'm looking for
         Em            C        G          D
You were willing but unable to give me anymore
               Em                 C
There's no way    you're changing
                        G             D
Cause some things will just never be mine
              Em     D   C
You're not in love this time... but it's alright

(Em  D  C  C) x 2

Em            D                 C
  I hear you talking, but your words don't mean a thing
Em            D              C
  I doubt you ever put your heart in anything
Em                 D              C
  It's not much to ask for, to get back what I put in
Em                 D              C
  But I chose the waters that I'm in

                           D                  Am
And it makes no difference   who is right or wrong
                           D
I deserve much more than this
Bm                 C
Cause there's only one thing I want

        Em               C
If it's not what you're made of
             G               D
You're not what I'm looking for
         Em            C        G          D
You were willing but unable to give me anymore
               Em                 C
There's no way    you're changing
                        G             D
Cause some things will just never be mine
              Em     D   C
You're not in love this time... but it's alright

Em                 C            B
  What's your definition of the one?
Em                 C             B
  What you really want him to become?
Em                  C               B
  No matter what I sacrifice it's still never enough

Em                D              C
  Just like I predicted, I will sink before I swim
Em                     D              C
  Cause these are the waters that I'm in

        Em               C
If it's not what you're made of
             G               D
You're not what I'm looking for
         Em            C        G          D
You were willing but unable to give me anymore
               Em                 C
There's no way    you're changing
                        G             D
Cause some things will just never be mine
              Em     D   C
You're not in love this time...

        Em               C
If it's not what you're made of
             G               D
You're not what I'm looking for
         Em            C        G          D
You were willing but unable to give me anymore
               Em                 C
There's no way    you're changing
                        G             D
Cause some things will just never be mine
              Em     D   C
You're not in love this time
              Em     D   C
You're not in love this time
              Em     D   C
You're not in love this time
