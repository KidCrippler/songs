The Other End of Time - Toto
Lyrics and Music: Randy Goodrum, Steve Lukather

Gm  Gm  Gm  Gm/F

Gm                                 Eb
   Sometimes it hurts clear to the core
        F4              F
When we lose all we've cared for
Gm
   The hunger and thirst
                Eb
For love that endures
         F4  F
Is never  ending

Cm7                /Bb  Eb
What will I do with my life?
        Bb                     F
Try to share it with somebody new?
    Cm7               /Bb  Eb
And how can I learn to disguise
        Bb/F  F  Eb/F   F
That I'm lost without  you

Bb                    D
All I have left is a heart full of mirrors
  Gm                     Fm7         Bb7     Ebmaj7
A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over
           Dm7  Gm7
Girl, it's   over
             Cm7
I'll hear it echo deep inside
         F            Bb    Eb
'Til the other end of time
                 Gm7     Eb
The other end of time

Gm                            Eb
   Leftover dreams fade in my mind
        F4            F          Gm
And I'm counting on this love to die
                                           Eb
'Cause all that I need is to give my whole life
        F4  F
A new beginning

    Cm7                 /Bb  Eb
But something is holding me  down
         Bb                    F
Like I'm under a mountain of stone
    Cm7               /Bb  Eb
And all I can hear is the  sound
      Bb/F  F    Eb/F  F
Of my  own heart  breaking

       Bb                    D
'Cause all I have left is a heart full of mirrors
  Gm                     Fm7         Bb7     Ebmaj7
A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over
           Dm7  Gm7
Girl, it's   over
             Cm7
I'll hear it echo deep inside
         F            Bb     Eb
'Til the other end of time
                 Gm7     Eb
Until the end of time

Ab   Gm7   F#   Bb   Eb   Eb

       Bb                    D
'Cause all I have left is a heart full of mirrors
  Gm                     Fm7         Bb7     Ebmaj7
A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over
           Dm7  Gm7
Girl, it's   over
             Cm7              F4   -  F  -
I'll hear it echo deep inside

Bb                    D
All I have left is a heart full of mirrors
  Gm                     Fm7         Bb7     Ebmaj7
A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over
           Dm7  Gm7
Girl, it's   over
             Cm7
I'll hear it echo deep inside
         F            Bb    Eb
'Til the other end of time
                Gm7    Eb
'Til the end of time
                 Bb    Eb
Until the end of time
                 Gm7   Eb
Until the end of time

{Fade Out}
