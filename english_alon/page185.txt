C                 G     F     C
Such a feeling's coming over me
         Em             Dm    G7      C
There is wonder in most every thing I see
       F            G           Em        A7
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
        Dm7                   /F               G7
And I            won't be surprised if it's a dream

C             G        F       C
Everything I want the world to be
       Em            Dm    G7     C
Is now coming true especially for me
         F          G           Em            A7
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
           Dm7              /F                G7
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

            C
I'm on the      top of the world looking
F
    Down on creation
        C         Dm     G      C     C7
And the only explanation I can find
        F             G7           C                  F
Is the love that I've found, ever since you've been around
             C            Dm  G7      C      C
Your love's put me at the top of the world

C                 G        F          C
Something in the wind has learned my name
         Em               Dm        G7       C
And it's telling me that things are not the same
        F             G            Em            A7
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
           Dm7              /F           G7
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me

C             G        F    C
There is only one wish on my mind
          Em               Dm        G7      C
When this day is through I hope that I will find
        F          G           Em               A7
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
      Dm7          /F             G7
All I need will be mine if you are here

            C
I'm on the      top of the world looking
F
    Down on creation
        C         Dm     G      C     C7
And the only explanation I can find
        F             G7           C                  F
Is the love that I've found, ever since you've been around
             C            Dm  G7      C
Your love's put me at the top of the world

{Drums stop}
            C                     /C     /D  /E
I'm on the      top of the world         looking
F                 /G
    Down on creation
{Drums come back}
/A  /B  C         Dm     G      C     C7
And the only explanation I can find
        F             G7           C                  F
Is the love that I've found, ever since you've been around
             C            Dm  G7      C      C
Your love's put me at the top of the world
