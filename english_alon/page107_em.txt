Em7  Em7  Em7   D  Cmaj7  Cmaj7  Cmaj7  Bm7
Am7  Am7  Bm7  Bm7  Em7    Em7    Am7   Bm7

              Em7
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone 
    D    Cmaj7
To let me know you made it home 
           Bm7            Am7       Bm7       Em7
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover 

              Em7
If she's with me I'll blink the lights 
    D      Cmaj7
To let you know tonight's the night 
    Bm7    Am7    Bm7       Em7
For me and you my part-time lover 

       C                          G
We are undercover passion on the run 
        Am7                Bm7    Em7
Chasing love up against the s  -  un 
          C                         G
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
                 Am7                  Bm7
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 

             Em7
If I'm with friends and we should meet 
      D     Cmaj7
Just pass me by, don't even speak 
         Bm7          Am7       Bm7       Em7
Know the word's "discreet" with part-time lovers 

               Em7
But if there's some emergency 
     D      Cmaj7
Have a male friend to ask for me 
   Bm7            Am7                     Bm7       Em7
So then she won't peek it's really you my part-time lover 

       C                          G
We are undercover passion on the run 
        Am7                Bm7    Em7
Chasing love up against the s  -  un 
          C                         G
We are strangers by day, lovers by night 
                 Am7                  Bm7
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right 

              Em7
I've got something that I must tell 
      D       Cmaj7
Last night someone rang our doorbell 
       Bm7     Am7    Bm7       Em7
And it was not you my part-time lover 

           Em7
And then a man called our exchange 
     D     Cmaj7
But didn't want to leave his name 
             Bm7              Am7     Bm7       Em7
I guess that two can play the game of part-time lovers 
        Am7  Bm7       Em7
You and me,  part-time lovers 
             Am7  Bm7       Em7
But, she and he,  part-time lovers  []
