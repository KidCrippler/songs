Honesty - Billy Joel
Lyrics and Music: Billy Joel

Am   Am/G   Fmaj7   E7

A                     D
   If you search for tenderness
E                   C#m7
   It isn't hard to find
D                   F#m7             G#m7     Bm7  - E7 -
   You can have the love you need to live
A                        B4     B       
   But if you look for truthfulness
          E/B    G#7/C    C#m
You might just as well be blind
   D              G#9            C#7   C#7
It always seems to be so hard to give

Dmaj7    E9   C#/F          F#m - E9 -
   Honesty is such a lonely word
D            E     A    C#7
Everyone is so untrue
Dmaj7    E9   C#/F        F#m - E -
   Honesty is hardly ever heard
     D             E    D/E  A    E -
And mostly what I need from you

A                D
   I can always find someone
E                   C#m7
   To say they sympathize
D               F#m7             G#m7     Bm7  - E7 -
   If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
A                         B4     B       
   But I don't want some pretty face
   E/B     G#7/C  C#m
To tell me pretty lies
D             G#9          C#7    C#7
All I want is someone to believe

Dmaj7    E9   C#/F          F#m - E9 -
   Honesty is such a lonely word
D            E     A    C#7
Everyone is so untrue
Dmaj7    E9   C#/F        F#m - E -
   Honesty is hardly ever heard
     D             E    D/A  A   Am/G   Fmaj7   E7
And mostly what I need from you

[F#m]
     I can find a lover
[C#/F#]
     I can find a friend
[Em]
     I can have security
 B/Eb
Until the bitter end
D              E
   Anyone can comfort me
      D/A       A
With promises again
  B9   B      E   C#       D/E
I know,   I know whoa whoa

A                   D
   When I'm deep inside of me
E                  C#m7
   Don't be too concerned
D                  F#m7              G#m7     Bm7  - E7 -
   I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone
A                     B4   B       
   But when I want sincerity
        E/B       G#7/C   C#m
Tell me where else can I  turn
       D                 G#9        C#7    C#7
Cause you're the one that I depend upon

Dmaj7    E9   C#/F                  F#m - E9 -
   Honesty         is such a lonely word
D            E     A    C#7
Everyone is so untrue
Dmaj7    E9   C#/F                F#m - E -
   Honesty         is hardly ever heard
     D             E    D/A  A   Am/G   Fmaj7   E7
And mostly what I need from you

Dm7   E7   A
