      Am              G             F    G - F -
I've been alone with you inside my mind
    Am                 G               
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips
F                    G - F -
   A thousand times
  Am                 G               F    G - F -
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
   Am   G         F                 A
Hello!     Is it me you're looking for?

       Dm            G
I can see it in your eyes
       C               F
I can see it in your smile
       Bb            E+     E
You're all I've ever wanted
       Am       Am/B   Am/C   Am/B
And my arms are open   wide
             Dm                G
Because you know just what to say
          C                F
And you know just what to do
      Bb                  E+     E
And I want to tell you so much...
       (Am  G  F  G - F - ) x 2  
I love you

  Am               G                F    G - F -
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
    Am                 G         F                 G - F -
And tell you time and time again   how much I care
    Am               G               F    G - F -
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
   Am   G              F                   A
Hello!      I've just got to let you know

       Dm               G
‘Cos I wonder where you are
       C               F
And I wonder what you do
        Bb                E+      E
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
      Am      Am/B   Am/C   Am/B
Or is someone loving you?
        Dm               G
Tell me how to win your heart
       C                F
For I haven't got a clue
    Bb                E+     E
But let me start by saying...
       (Am  G  F  G - F - ) x 2
I love you

   Am   G         F                     A

And I wonder what you do
        Bb                    E+  E
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
