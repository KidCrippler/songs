Back For Good - Take That
Lyrics and Music: Gary Barlow

F  Gm7  Bb  F - C -
F  Gm7  Bb  F - C - [][]

F        Gm7         Bb   C
  I guess   now it's time
               F
For me to give up 
Gm7            Bb   F - C -
   I feel it's time 
       F               Gm7
Got a picture of you beside me 
           Bb
Got you're lipstick mark
      C                 
still on your coffee cup
F  Gm7    Bb   F - C -
      (Oh yeah)
       F            Gm7
Got a fist of pure emotion 
      Bb                  C
Got a head of shattered dreams 
       Dm             Dm/C        
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all
  Bb       F - C -
behind now 

    F               Gm7                  Bb
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
        C                 F
I just want you back for good
               Gm7
(Want you back,   want you back
Bb                   C
  want you back for good)
    F                   Gm7
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song
         Bb
and I'll sing it
           C              F
You'll be right and understood 
               Gm7
(Want you back,   want you back
Bb                   C
  want you back for good)

F        Gm7              Bb   C
  Unaware   but underlined
                     F          Gm7
I figured out this story (no no)
          Bb          C
It wasn't good (no no)
            F           Gm7                Bb    C
But in the corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
              F     Gm7
I celebrated glory 
         Bb         F - C -
But that was not to be 
         F          Gm7
In the twist of separation
      Bb               C
You excelled at being free 
          Dm
Can't you find (can't you find)
         Dm/C            Bb  C
a little room inside for me 

    F               Gm7                  Bb
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
        C                 F
I just want you back for good
               Gm7
(Want you back,   want you back
Bb                   C
  want you back for good)
    F                   Gm7
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song
         Bb
and I'll sing it
           C              F
You'll be right and understood 
               Gm7
(Want you back,   want you back
Bb                   C
  want you back for good)

BbMaj7                 F/A
      And we'll be together
BbMaj7               F/A
      This time is forever 
Gm7                        F/A
   We'll be fighting and forever we will be 
       Dm         Dm/C
So complete in our love 
        Bb7        F/A       C   C   C7
We will never be uncovered again 

    F               Gm7                  Bb
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
        C                 F
I just want you back for good
               Gm7
(Want you back,   want you back
Bb                   C
  want you back for good)
    F                   Gm7
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song
         Bb
and I'll sing it
           C              F
You'll be right and understood 
               Gm7
(Want you back,   want you back
Bb                   C
  want you back for good)

    F               Gm7                  Bb
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it 
        C                 F
I just want you back for good
               Gm7
(Want you back,   want you back
Bb                   C
  want you back for good)
    F                   Gm7
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song
         Bb
and I'll sing it
           C              F
You'll be right and understood 
               Gm7
(Want you back,   want you back
Bb                   C
  want you back for good)

F  Gm7    Bb   F - C -
      (Oh Yeah)
F   Gm7            Bb
  I guess now it's time
      F        C           F
That you came back... for good
