Beyonce - Creazy in love


{Verse}
G
I look and stare so deep in your eyes 
D
I touch on you more and more every time 
Am
When you leave I'm beggin you not to go 
C
Call your name two, three times in a row 
G
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain 
D
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame 
Am
Yeah, cause I know I don't understand 
C
Just how your love can do what no on else can 

{Chorus}
G
Got me lookin so crazy right now

Your love's got me lookin so crazy right now  (Your love) 
Am
Got me lookin so crazy right now your touch's

C

{Verse}
G
When I talk to my friends so quietly 
D
"Who he think he is?" Look at what you've done to me 
Am
Tennis shoes don't even need to buy a new dress 
C
You ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress 

G
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew 
D
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you 
Am
Yeah, but I still don't understand 
C
Just how your love can do what no one else can 

{Chorus}

Got me lookin so crazy right now
