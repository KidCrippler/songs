Hero - Mariah Carey
Lyrics: Mariah Carey   Music: Mariah Carey, Walter Afanasieff

C   /B   Am   G
F   Em   Dm   G

          C            /Bb
There's a hero, if you look inside your heart
          Am                            G4     G
You don't have to be afraid of what you are
            C             /D
There's an answer, if you reach into your soul
        G#
And the sorrow that you know
          G4      G
Will melt away

C                   /B     Am
    And then a hero comes along
                     G     F
With the strength to carry on
                  Em     Dm
And you cast your fears aside
         G              C
And you know you can survive
            C         /B      Am
So when you feel like hope is gone
       G                 F
Look inside you and be strong
                   Em      Dm
And you'll finally see the truth
       G            C
That a hero lies in you

C   /B   Am   F 

        C
It's a long road
         /Bb
When you face the world alone
       F/A
No one reaches out a hand
           G4      G
For you to hold
        C
You can find love
       /D
If you search within yourself
        G#
And the emptiness you felt
          G4     G
Will disappear

C                   /B     Am
    And then a hero comes along
                     G     F
With the strength to carry on
                  Em     Dm
And you cast your fears aside
         G              C
And you know you can survive
            C         /B      Am
So when you feel like hope is gone
       G                 F
Look inside you and be strong
                   Em      Dm
And you'll finally see the truth
       G            C
That a hero lies in you (oh ohhhhh)

G#          Eb               Bb
      Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow
G#                  Eb     [Eb]      [Bb]
      But don't let anyone tear them away
G#        Eb             Bb
     Hold on, there will be tomorrow
G#       Eb                   G4    G4    -  G   -
      In time you'll find the way

C                   /B     Am
    And then a hero comes along
                     G     F
With the strength to carry on
                  Em     Dm
And you cast your fears aside
         G              C
And you know you can survive
            C         /B      Am
So when you feel like hope is gone
       G                 F
Look inside you and be strong
                   Em      Dm
And you'll finally see the truth
        G           F     /E
That a hero lies in you
Dm            G               
      That a hero lies in...
C           /B   Am     G    F  
      you                        (mmm)
       G                C
That a hero lies in...      you
