Forever Young - Alphaville
Lyrics and Music: Bernhard Lloyd, Marian Gold, Frank Mertens

C   G   Am   F   G   Dm   F   Am   G -

C                  G                       Am
  Let's start in style, let's dance for a while
            F                             G
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
               Dm                       F
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
                       Am            G -
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

C             G                     Am
  Let us die young or let us live forever
                   F                       G
We don't have the power, but we never say never
             Dm                   F
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
                    Am      G -
The music's for the sad man

C           G                       Am
  Can you imagine when this race is won
                 F                 G
Turn our golden faces into the sun
             Dm                         F
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
                         Am       G -
The music's played by the... the madman

C           G
  Forever young
          Am          F
I want to be Forever young
G                       Dm
  Do you really want to live forever?
F         G
  Forever,  we’ll never
C           G
  Forever young
          Am          F
I want to be Forever young
G                       Dm
  Do you really want to live forever?
F   G           [C]   G  -  F  -
       Forever young

C                G                           Am
  Some are like water, some are like the heat
            F                       G
Some are a melody and some are the beat
          Dm                      F
Sooner or later they all will be gone
                    Am     G -
Why don't they stay young?

C                     G                  Am
  It's so hard to get old without a cause
                 F                        G
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
              Dm                F
Youth’s like diamonds in the sun
                   Am     G -
And diamonds are forever

C            G                         Am
  So many adventures couldn’t happen today
         F                     G
So many songs we forgot to play
         Dm                          F
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
                     Am   G -
We’ll let them come true

C           G
  Forever young
          Am          F
I want to be Forever young
G                       Dm
  Do you really want to live forever?
F         G
  Forever,  we’ll never
C           G
  Forever young
          Am          F
I want to be Forever young
G                       Dm            F   G
  Do you really want to live forever?

C   G   Am   F
G   Dm   F   G
C   G   Am   F
G   Dm   F   G
C   G   Am   F
G   Dm   F   G
