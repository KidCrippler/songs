Those Magic Changes - Sha Na Na
Lyrics and Music: Jim Jacobs, Warren Casey

(A   F#m   D   E) x 2

  A                        F#m
What's that playing on the radio?
  D                     E
Why do I start swaying to and fro?
A                       F#m
I have never heard that song before
 D                     E
But if I don't hear it anymore

       A
It's still familiar to me
F#m
Sends a thrill right through me
  D
'Cause those chords remind me of
     E
the night that I first fell in love to

A               F#m
   Those magic changes
D              E
   My heart arranges
      A         F#m
A melody that's never the same
      D          E
A melody that's calling your name
              A          F#m
It begs you please, come back to me
  D        E
Please, return to me

           A                       F#m
Don't go away again, oh make them play again
          D                      E
The music I wanna hear is once again
                  A    F#m
You whisper in my ear
D      E         A   F#m
Oh my darling, aha
      D          E
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoooo

A                      F#m
I'll be waiting by the radio
 D                          E
You'll come back to me someday, I know
 A                         F#m
Been so lonesome since our last goodbye
 D                     E
But I'm singin' as I cry-ay-ay

  A
While the bass is sounding
 F#m
While the drums are pounding
 D                                E
Beatings of my broken heart will rise the first place of the charts
A                F#m      D                E
  Oh, my heart arranges, oh, those magic changes

A      F#m
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
D      E
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
    A
Oh yeah
  D          Dm           A   
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoooo
