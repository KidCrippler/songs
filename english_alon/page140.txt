I Don't Want To Miss a Thing - Aerosmith
Lyrics and Music: Diane Warren

(Am   Bm   D) x 4

          C         G            Am
I could stay awake just to hear breathing
            F                   C
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
              Dm           
While you are far away and dreaming
          C           G            Am
I could spend my life in this sweet  surrender
          F                C       Dm
I could stay lost in this moment forever
               Em         F                 G       G
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

   C            G         
I don't wanna close my eyes
Dm               
   I don't wanna fall asleep
         F
Cause I miss you baby
                   G        C
And I don't wanna miss a thing
                    G
Cause even when I dream of you
Dm                         
   The sweetest dream will never do
         F
I still miss you baby
                   G        C   G   Dm
And I don't wanna miss a thing

        C            G                Am
Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
       F                       C
And I wondering what you are dreaming
          Dm                   
Wondering if it's me you are seeing
        C                   G              Am
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
