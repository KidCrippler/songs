Lyrics and Music: Kelly Clarkson, David Hodges, Ben Moody

Em   C   D4   D
Em   C   D    D

G            Bm       Em
  I will not make the same mistakes that you did
D   G          Bm         Em
I     will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
D - G             Bm       Em                       D -
      I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
G                   Bm          Em                     D   D
   I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

           Em          Cmaj7                   D
Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk,
           Em                           Cmaj7           D             B7
Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
           Am7                    G/B            D                B7
Because of you I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
           Cmaj7        D
Because of you, I am afraid

G           Bm            Em                       D       G
  I lose my way, and it's not too long before you point it out
          Bm     Em                            D       G
I cannot cry, because you know that's weakness in your eyes
              Bm      Em                    D         G
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
               Bm                      Em                     D         D
My heart can't possibly break, when it wasn't even whole to start with

           Em          Cmaj7                   D
Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk,
           Em                           Cmaj7           D             B7
Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
           Am7                    G/B            D                B7
Because of you I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
           Cmaj7        D
Because of you, I am afraid

              Bm                Em                 D
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
         Bm                      Em                   D
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
           Bm               Em                  D
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
           Bm                      Em              D               D
And now I cry in the middle of the night, for the same damn thing

           Em          Cmaj7                   D
Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk,
           Em                           Cmaj7           D             []
Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
           F#m                  Dmaj7          E
Because of you I try my hardest just to forget everything
           F#m                    Dmaj7       E
Because of you I don't know how to let anyone else in
           Bm7                   A/C#              E7    C#7
Because of you I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
           Dmaj7         E
Because of you I am, afraid
           F#m   D   E   E4
Because of you
           F#m   D   E
because of you
