D          A/D        D                       G    G
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
D    A/D         D                       G    G
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
 D              D+
Look at me now,    will I ever learn?
D                D+                 G
I don't know how    but I suddenly lose control
                   A
There's a fire within my soul
 G   D    A
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
G    D    A                                   [D]  -->
One more look and I forget everything, wooooh

-->  D
        Mamma mia, here I go again
G  C  G 
   My my, how can I resist you?
D
    Mamma mia, does it show again?
G  C  G 
   My my, just how much I've missed you
D                  A/C#
   Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Bm               Bm/A
   Blue since the day we parted
G   C    G  Em7         A
   Why, why did I ever let you go?
D             Bm
   Mamma mia,    now I really know
G  C  G  Em7             A
   My my, I could never let you go

D         A/D        D                         G    G
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
D       A/D            D                                G     G
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
D                D+
And when you go,    when you slam the door
D                D+                     G
I think you know    that you won't be away too long
                   A
You know that I'm not that strong
 G   D    A
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
G    D    A                                   [D]  -->
One more look and I forget everything, wooooh

        Mamma mia, here I go again

D
    Mamma mia, does it show again?

   My my, just how much I've missed you
D                  A/C#
   Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Bm               Bm/A
   Blue since the day we parted
G   C    G  Em7         A
   Why, why did I ever let you go?

D
   Mamma mia, even if I say
G   C  G 
   Bye bye, leave me now or never
D
   Mamma mia, it's a game we play
G   C   G 
   Bye bye doesn't mean forever

D
   Mamma mia, here I go again
G  C  G 
   My my, how can I resist you?
D
    Mamma mia, does it show again?
G  C  G 
   My my, just how much I've missed you

   Yes, I've been brokenhearted
