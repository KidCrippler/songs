Eb        E
     The warden threw a party in the county jail
Eb        E
     The prison band was there and they began to wail
Eb        E
     The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
Eb        E
     You should've heard them knocked-out jailbirds sing

      A7                     E
Let's rock! Everybody let's rock!
     B7                      A7
Everybody in the whole cell block
     E
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock!

Eb    E
     Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Eb   E
     Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
Eb        E
     The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
Eb       E
     The whole rhythm section was the purple gang

      A7                     E
Let's rock! Everybody let's rock!
     B7                      A7
Everybody in the whole cell block
     E
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock!

Eb   E
     Number forty seven said to number three:
Eb    E
     "You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
Eb     E
     I sure would be delighted with your company
Eb        E
     Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"

      A7                     E
Let's rock! Everybody let's rock!
     B7                      A7
Everybody in the whole cell block
     E
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock!

E   E   E   E   B7   A7   E   E

Eb   E
     Sad sack was sittin' on a block of stone
Eb       E
     Way over in the corner weeping all alone
Eb       E
     The warden said: "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
Eb      E
     If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"

      A7                     E
Let's rock! Everybody let's rock!
     B7                      A7
Everybody in the whole cell block
     E
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock!

Eb    E
     Shifty Henry said to Bugs: "For Heaven's sakes
Eb   E
     No one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break
Eb   E
     Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said "Nix, nix
Eb     E
     I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks"

      A7                     E
Let's rock! Everybody let's rock!
     B7                      A7
Everybody in the whole cell block
     E
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock!
E
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock!
E
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock!
E
Dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock!
