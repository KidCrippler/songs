I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor
Lyrics and Music: Freddie Perren and Dino Fekaris

C#    Bo7

   F#m                        Bm
At first, I was afraid, I was petrified
              E                             Amaj7
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
           Dmaj7                        G#m7b5
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
             C#4                 C#
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

              F#m              Bm
And so you're back from outer space
              E
I just walked in to find you here
             Amaj7
With that sad look upon your face
              Dmaj7
I should have changed that stupid lock
             G#m7b5
I should have made you leave your key
          C#4
If I had known for just one second
         C#
You'd be back to bother me

          F#m               Bm
Go on now go, walk out the door
           E                          Amaj7
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Dmaj7                                G#m7b5
     Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
                   C#4                       C#
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

           F#m           Bm
Oh, no, not I, I will survive
        E                            Amaj7
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
        Dmaj7                             G#m7b5
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
            C#4               C#      F#m
And I'll survive, I will survive, Hey Hey

F#m  Bm  E  Amaj7  Dmaj7  G#m7b5  C#4  C#

        F#m                           Bm
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
             E                            Amaj7
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
            Dmaj7                           G#m7b5
And I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
          C#4            C#
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

            F#m          Bm
And you see me somebody new
               E                              Amaj7
I'm not that chained-up little person still in love with you
           Dmaj7                            G#m7b5
And so you felt like dropping in, and just expect me to be free
            C#4                          C#
And now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

          F#m               Bm
Go on now go, walk out the door
           E                          Amaj7
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Dmaj7                                G#m7b5
     Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
                   C#4                       C#
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

           F#m            Bm
Oh, no, not I, I will survive
        E                            Amaj7
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
        Dmaj7                             G#m7b5
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
            C#4             C#
And I'll survive, I will survive... Oh...

          F#m               Bm
Go on now go, walk out the door
           E                          Amaj7
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Dmaj7                                G#m7b5
     Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
                   C#4                       C#
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

           F#m           Bm
Oh, no, not I, I will survive
        E                            Amaj7
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
        Dmaj7                             G#m7b5
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
            C#4             C#              F#m
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive
