When I Was Your Man – Bruno Mars
Lyrics and Music: Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, Peter Gene Hernandez, Ari Levine, Andrew Wyatt

G7  Gm  F  F  G7  Gm  F  Am/E

Dm                  F                      Gm
   Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
C                  C7                  F             Am
   Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
Dm                         F
   When our friends talk about you all it does is
     Gm
just tear me down
C                                          F
  'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
   Am                   Dm  Am
It all just sounds like oooooh…
Eb                           F
  Too young, too dumb to realize

     C                       Bb
That I should've bought you flowers
C                F
  And held your hand
                          Bb
Should've gave you all my hours
C             F
  When I had the chance
                  Bb
Take you to every party
                C               Dm
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
G7            Bb
Now my baby's dancing
          Bbm                   F   Am/E
But she's dancing with another man

Dm             F                      Gm
  My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
C                      C7         
  Caused a good strong woman like you to walk
 F          Am
out my life
      Dm      F                        Gm
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made 
C                                    F
  And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
   Am                   Dm   Am
It all just sounds like oooooh…
Eb                           F
  Too young, too dumb to realize

     C                       Bb
That I should've bought you flowers
C                F
  And held your hand
                          Bb
Should've gave you all my hours
C             F
  When I had the chance
                  Bb
Take you to every party
                C               Dm
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
 G7           Bb
Now my baby's dancing
          Bbm                   F
But she's dancing with another man

            Bb
Although it hurts
             C                       F  C  Dm  Am
I'll be the first to say that I was wrooooooooong
        G7
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
            Gm
To try and apologize for my mistakes
            C
But I just want you to know  []

                    Bb
I hope he buys you flowers
C                       F
  I hope he holds your hand
                 Bb
Give you all his hours
C            F
  When he has the chance
                  Bb
Take you to every party
            C                     Dm
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
G7                   Bb
Do all the things I should have done
Bbm                 F
   When I was your man
G7                     Bb
  Do all the things I should have done
Bbm                 F
   When I was your man
