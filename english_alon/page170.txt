Circle Of Life - Elton John
Lyrics and Music: Elton John

(A   F#m7   Bm7   E) x 2

          A                   Bm7/A
From the day we arrive on the planet
      E/G#                    A
And, blinking, step into the sun
        F#m7                     Bm7
There's more to be seen than can ever be seen
        G                   E4   E
More to do than can ever be done

A                      Bm7/A
   Some say "eat or be eaten"
         E/G#                   A    /G#   -
Some say      "live and let live"
    F#m                    Bm7
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
            G                       E4
You should never take more then you give

          E         A    A4   -  A   -
It's the Circle of Life
                  G/A
It's the wheel of fortune
                  D     D4   -  D  -
It's the leap of faith
                 E4    E
It's the band of hope
                 A/C#
Till we find our place
F#7               Bm
    On the path unwinding
Dm6/F          A      E4
       In the Circle
    E7        D/A    A
The Circle of Life

 A                       Bm7/A
Some of us fall by the wayside
    E/G#                     A    /G#  -
And some of us soar to the stars
    F#m                             Bm7
And some of us sail through our troubles
     G                          E4    E
And some have to live with the scars

         A                 Bm7/A
Thereâ€™s far too much to take in here
        E/G#                   A     /G#  -
More to find than can ever be found
        F#m                           Bm7
But the sun rolling high, through the sapphire sky
                  G                   E4
Keeps great and small on the endless round

          E         A    A4   -  A   -
In the Circle of Life
                  G/A
It's the wheel of fortune
                  D     D4   -  D  -
It's the leap of faith
                 E4    E
It's the band of hope
                 A/C#
Till we find our place
F#7               Bm
    On the path unwinding
Dm6/F          A      E4
       In the Circle
    E7         A
The Circle of Life

                  G/A
It's the wheel of fortune
                  D     D4  -  D  -
It's the leap of faith
                 E4    E
It's the band of hope
                 A/C#
Till we find our place
F#7               Bm
    On the path unwinding
Dm6/F          A      E4
       In the Circle
    E7        D/A    A   A4   -  A  
The Circle of Life

{Quieter}
F#7               Bm      Dm6/F
    On the path unwinding (yeah)
        A      E4
In the Circle
    E7        D/A    F/A    A
The Circle of Life
