Skyfall - Adele
Lyrics and Music: Adele, Paul Richard Epworth

(Cm     /G#   /F   /F) x 3
Cm/D   Cm/D   G4    G

     Cm         /G#    /F
This is the end
                     Cm    /G#         /F
Hold your breath and count     to ten
               Cm       /G#    /F
Feel the Earth move and then
              /D      G4    -   G   -
Hear my heart burst again

         Cm         G#    Ao/F
For this is the end
     G#/F                    Cm     G#   Ao/F
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
   G#/F      Cm   G#    Ao/F
So overdue I owe them
G#/F           Cm/D     G
Swept away I'm stolen

        Cm
Let the sky fall
/Bb      G#
When it crumbles
G#/G      Fm
 We will stand tall
   Fm/Eb    Fm/D   G
And face it all together

        Cm
Let the sky fall
/Bb      G#
When it crumbles
G#/G      Fm
 We will stand tall
   Fm/Eb    Fm/D     
And face it all together
G     Cm    G#    Ao/F    G#/F
At Skyfall
      Cm    G#    Ao/F    G#/F
At Skyfall

           Cm            G#    Ao/F
Skyfall is where we start
  G#/F               Cm           G#    Ao/F
A thousand miles and poles apart
      G#/F               Cm             G#
Where worlds collide and days are dark
                Ao/F            G#/F          Fm/D
You may have my number, you can take my name
                          G
But you'll never have my heart

        Cm
Let the sky fall
/Bb      G#
When it crumbles
G#/G      Fm
 We will stand tall
   Fm/Eb    Fm/D   G
And face it all together

        Cm
Let the sky fall
/Bb      G#
When it crumbles
G#/G      Fm
 We will stand tall
   Fm/Eb    Fm/D     
And face it all together

Where you go I go

I know I'll never be me without the security
