I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor
Lyrics and Music: Freddie Perren and Dino Fekaris

E    Do7

   Am                         Dm
At first, I was afraid, I was petrified
              G                             Cmaj7
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
           Fmaj7                        Bm7b5
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
             E4                   E
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

              Am               Dm
And so you're back from outer space
              G
I just walked in to find you here
             Cmaj7
With that sad look upon your face
              Fmaj7
I should have changed that stupid lock
             Bm7b5
I should have made you leave your key
          E4
If I had known for just one second
          E
You'd be back to bother me

          Am               Dm
Go on now go, walk out the door
           G                          Cmaj7
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Fmaj7                                Bm7b5
     Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
                   E4                         E
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

           Am            Dm
Oh, no, not I, I will survive
        G                            Cmaj7
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
        Fmaj7                             Bm7b5
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
            E4               E        Am
And I'll survive, I will survive, Hey Hey

Am  Dm  G  Cmaj7  Fmaj7  Bm7b5  E4  E

        Am                            Dm
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
             G                            Cmaj7
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
            Fmaj7                           Bm7b5
And I spent, oh, so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
          E4              E
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

            Am           Dm
And you see me somebody new
               G                              Cmaj7
I'm not that chained-up little person still in love with you
          Fmaj7                             Bm7b5
And so you felt like dropping in, and just expect me to be free
            E4                           E
And now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

          Am               Dm
Go on now go, walk out the door
           G                          Cmaj7
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Fmaj7                                Bm7b5
     Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
                   E4                         E
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

           Am            Dm
Oh, no, not I, I will survive
        G                            Cmaj7
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
        Fmaj7                             Bm7b5
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
            E4               E
And I'll survive, I will survive... Oh...

          Am               Dm
Go on now go, walk out the door
           G                          Cmaj7
Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Fmaj7                                Bm7b5
     Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
                   E4                         E
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

           Am            Dm
Oh, no, not I, I will survive
        G                            Cmaj7
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
        Fmaj7                             Bm7b5
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
            E4               E              Am
And I'll survive, I will survive, I will survive

Am  Dm  G  Cmaj7  Fmaj7  Bm7b5  E4  E
Am
