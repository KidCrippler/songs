        A           E             A
Desert love in your eyes all the way
      A              E             A
If I listen to your lie would you say
       D                  E           
I'm a man without out conviction
       D               E
I'm a man who doesn't know
        D            E
How to sell a contradiction
             D/B
You come and go
             F#m  [E]
You come and go

 A                       E          F#m

 A                            E                   F#m

        A                E           A
Didn't hear your wicked words every day
        A               E                A
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say
         D             E
That my love was an addiction
          D                  E
When we cling our love is strong
          D                E
When you go you're gone forever
            Bm
You string along
            F#m   [E]
You string along

 A                       E          F#m

D                      C#m
Every day is like a survival
 D                      F#m
You're my lover, not my rival
D                      C#m
Every day is like a survival
 D                     F#m   E
You're my lover, not my rival
