Send Me an Angel - Scorpions
Lyrics and Music: Meine Klaus

(Dm   Bb   C   Am   Dm   Bb   C   C) x 4

    Dm       Bb         C        Am
The wise man said just walk this way
Dm        Bb           C      C
   To the dawn of the light
    Dm         Bb     C      Am
The wind will blow into your face
Dm        Bb              C      C
   As the years pass you by

Dm        Bb          C     Am
Hear this voice from deep inside
Dm          Bb            C      C
   It's the call of your heart
 Dm        Bb        C       Am
Close your eyes and you will find
Dm             Bb          C      C
   The passage out of the dark

Em        D          Bm
   Here I am (Here I am)
          C         D
Will you send me an angel?
Em        D          Bm
   Here I am (Here I am)

In the land of the morning star

Em         C           D     D
   In the eye of the storm
 Em       C      D       Bm
Seek the roses along the way
Em         C            D     D
   Just beware of the thorns
