Em           Bm
    You're a song
  C             D       Em
Written by the hands of God
              Bm
Don't get me wrong
         C                  D    /D#  Em
'Cause this might sound to you a bit  odd
        D         C
But you own the place
      D       /D#        Em   D
Where all my thoughts go hiding
    Am
And right under your clothes
    D
Is where I find them

G       G/B          C
   Underneath your clothes
           D
There's an endless story
G              G/B     C
   There's the man I chose
            D
There's my territory
    Bm                 Em
And all the things I deserve
    Am           D4          D     G    C
For being such a good girl, honey

Em            Bm
    'Cause of you
C              D           Em
I forgot the smart ways to lie
           Bm
Because of you
     C              D     /D#  Em
I'm running out of reasons to cry
           D          C
When the friends are gone
  D      /D#     Em  D
When the party's over
Am                    D
We will still belong to each other

G       G/B          C
   Underneath your clothes
           D
There's an endless story
G              G/B     C
   There's the man I chose
            D
There's my territory
    Bm                 Em
And all the things I deserve
    Am           D4          D
For being such a good girl, honey

G       G/B          C
   Underneath your clothes
           D
There's an endless story
G              G/B     C
   There's the man I chose
            D
There's my territory
    Bm                 Em
And all the things I deserve
     C
For being such a good girl
     C
For being such a...

  Bb                 F
I love you more than all that's on the planet
Gm                           F
    Movin' talkin' walkin' breathing
     Eb
You know it's true, oh babe, it's so funny
    F
You almost don't believe it
   Bb              F
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Gm                             F
   Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Eb
Like a lady tied to her manners
     F                 Em   --->
I'm tied up to this feeling

   Underneath your clothes
           D
There's an endless story

   There's the man I chose

G       G/B          C        D
   Underneath your clothes (Whoa)
G              G/B     C
   There's the man I chose
            D
There's my territory

And all the things I deserve
    Am
For being such a good girl

For being such a good girl
