Breakfast at Tiffany's - Deep Blue Something
Lyrics and Music: Pipes Todd David

(D   G/B - A -) x 2

        D    G/B       A          D
You'll say, we've got nothing in common
   G/B      A         D
No common ground to start from
    G/B       A     D     G/B  -   A  -
And we're falling apart
        D       G/B        A       D
You'll say, the world has come between us
    G/B         A       D
Our lives have come between us
     G/B      A            D     G/B  -  A  -
Still I know you just don't care

    D                   A          G/B
And I said what about Breakfast at Tiffany's
     D                A         G/B
She said I think I remember the film and 
   D                    A           G/B
As I recall I think we both kind of liked it
    D                      A               G/B 
And I said well that's the one thing we've got

(D   G/B - A -) x 2

   D          G/B   A         D           
I see you, the only one who knew me
    G/B      A           D
And now your eyes see through me 
G/B    A         D       G/B   -   A  -
    I guess I was wrong
     D             G/B      A        D
So what now? It's plain to see we're over
      G/B         A        D
And I hate when things are over 
     G/B         A      D     G/B  -  A  -
When so much is left undone

    D                   A          G/B
And I said what about Breakfast at Tiffany's
     D                A         G/B
She said I think I remember the film and 
   D                    A           G/B
As I recall I think we both kind of liked it
    D                      A               G/B 
And I said well that's the one thing we've got

 [D]         G/B       A          D
You'll say, we've got nothing in common
   G/B      A         D
No common ground to start from
    G/B       A     D     G/B  -   A  -
And we're falling apart
 D              G/B        A       D
You'll say, the world has come between us
    G/B         A       D
Our lives have come between us
     G/B      A            D     G/B  -  A  -
Still I know you just don't care
