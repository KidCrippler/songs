      C      Em/B      Am          /G
It's Nine o'clock on a Saturday
     F       C/E           D7    G
The regular crowd shuffles in
           C    Em/B       Am            /G
There's an old man sitting next to me
        F          /G         C    C
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

{Harmonica}  C   Em/B   Am   /G   F   /G   C   C   F/C   F/C

          C           Em/B      Am        /G
He says "Son, can you play me a memory?
     F         C/E         D7      G
I'm not really sure how it goes
          C            Em/B        Am         /G
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
     F        /G              C       C
When I wore a younger man's clothes"

Am    /G       D7/F#    F
La la la, di di da
Am     /G       D7/F#  F        G    /F   /E   /D
    La la, di di da         da dum

 C        Em/B              Am          /G
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
 F        C/E    D7      G
Sing us a song tonight
            C          Em/B       Am        /G
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
     F             /G        C     C
And you've got us feelin' alright

     C         Em/B       Am              /G
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
    F          C/E        D7     G
He gets me my drinks for free
          C           Em/B
And he's quick with a joke
      Am             /G
or to light up your smoke, but there’s
 F             /G           C   C   F/C   F/C
someplace that he'd rather be

          C       Em/B           Am          /G
He says "Bill, I believe this is killing me"
         F        C/E          D7     G
As the smile ran away from his face
           C          Em/B       Am          /G
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
   F           /G            C     C
If I could get out of this place"

Am    /G       D7/F#    F
La la la, di di da
Am     /G       D7/F#  F        G    /F   /E   /D
    La la, di di da         da dum

     C        Em/B        Am          /G
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
     F        C/E         D7     G
Who never had time for a wife
          C           Em/B
And he's talkin' with Davy
       Am          /G
who's still in the navy
     F       /G           C     C
And probably will be for life

{Harmonica}  C   Em/B   Am   /G   F   /G   C   C   F/C   F/C

         C          Em/B       Am         /G
And the waitress is practicing politics
        F          C/E         D7       G
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
               C        Em/B
Yes, they're sharing a drink
          Am            /G
they call loneliness
          F           /G        C      C
But it's better than drinkin' alone

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
         F      C/E         D7     G
And the manager gives me a smile
            C            Em/B             Am        /G
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
       F        /G           C   C   F/C   F/C
To forget about life for a while

         C        Em/B          Am         /G
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
         F         C/E           D7     G
And the microphone smells like a beer
          C         Em/B
And they sit at the bar
         Am         /G
and put bread in my jar
          F            /G         C       C
And say "Man, what are you doin' here?"

Am    /G       D7/F#    F
La la la, di di da
Am     /G       D7/F#  F        G    /F   /E   /D

Sing us a song, you're the piano man

Sing us a song tonight
