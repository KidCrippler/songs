 A       E
Listen
       F#m             C#m7
To the song here in my heart
   D                       E
A melody I start but can't   complete
 A      E
Listen (mmm)
       F#m               C#m7
To the sound from deep within
     D                      E
It's only beginning to find   release

         C
Oh, the time has come 
    E7
For my dreams to be heard
Am                           G
   They will not be pushed aside and turned
F                                    E7
Into your own, all 'cause you wonâ€™t listen

 A
Listen 
                  E
I am alone at a crossroads
                      F#m
I'm not at home in my own home 
           E
And I've tried and tried 
              D
To say what's on my mind 
 E
You should have known 

A                           E
Oh, now I'm done believing you 
You don't know what I'm feeling 
    D/F#               E/G#
I'm more than what you made of me 
  C#7                 F#m
I found the voice you gave to me 
D/A                         E
   But now I've got to find   my own 

                 A         E
You should have listened
         F#m            C#m7
There is someone here inside
    D                               E
Someone I thought had died so long ago 

           C
Oh, I'm screamin' out
    E7
And my dreams will be heard
Am                         G
   They will not be pushed   aside or worse
F                                    E7
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

 A

Oh, now I'm done believing you

    D/F#               E/G#
I'm more than what you made of me 
  C#7                 F#m
I found the voice you gave to me 
D/A                         A - G# - G - F# - C
   But now I've got to find my own

C                      E7
  I don't know where I belong
    Am                G
But I'll be moving on 
        F            E7
If you don't, if you won't
