Can't Take My Eyes Off You - Frankie Valli
Lyrics and Music: Bob Crewe, Bob Gaudio, Robert Gaudio

(E/D   Gm6/D   D   D) x 2

                 D
You're just too good to be true
              Dmaj7
Can't take my eyes off you
              D7
You'd be like heaven to touch
         G
I wanna hold you so much
             Gm
At long last love has arrived
             D
And I thank God I'm alive
                E/D              Gm/D
You're just too good to be true
              D
Can't take my eyes off of you
 
            D
Pardon the way that I stare
                Dmaj7
There's nothing else to compare
             D7
The sight of you leaves me weak
              G
There are no words left to speak
          Gm
So if you feel like I feel
                D
Please let me know that it's real
                E/D              Gm/D
You're just too good to be true
              D
Can't take my eyes off of you
