Lyrics and Music: Per Gessle

{Drums Intro}

C   C   F   F
     C                           F
(It must have been love but it's over now)

        C
Lay a whisper on my pillow
           F              G
Leave the winter on the ground
           C                      F
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
       Dm               G
In the bedroom and all around
         Am              C               F    G
Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away

                   C                  F
It must have been love but it's over now
                  Dm         Am           G
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
                   C                  F
It must have been love but it's over now
                    Dm               Am            G
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out

         C
Make-believing we're together
           F                G
That I'm sheltered by your heart
            C                      F
But in and outside I've turned to water
       Dm                G
Like a teardrop in your palm
           Am             C           F     G
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away

                   C                  F
It must have been love but it's over now
                  Dm              Am         G
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
                   C                 Gm
It must have been love but it's over now
                C                          Bb          Bb
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

Dm   C   Bb   Dm
F    C   Bb   Dm  -  C  -

                   F                 Bb
It must have been love but it's over now
                   Gm        Dm           C
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
                   F                 Bb
It must have been love but it's over now
                   Gm                Dm           C
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out

                   F                 Bb
It must have been love but it's over now
                  Gm              Dm         C
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
                   F                 Cm
It must have been love but it's over now
                F                          Eb          Eb
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

  F                           Bb                      Gm   Dm   C
Must have been love (but it's over now) but it's over now
  F                           Bb                      Gm   Dm   C
Must have been love (but it's over now) but it's over now
