It's Not Unusual - Tom Jones
Lyrics and Music: Les Reed and Gordon Mills

Cmaj7   Cmaj7   Dm7   Dm7   Cmaj7   Cmaj7   Dm7   Dm7

Cmaj7                         Dm7         G7
       It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
Cmaj7                           Dm7
       It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
Em7                                 Dm7
       But when I see you hanging about with anyone
G7                         Cmaj7             Dm7       G7
       It's not unusual to see me cry, and I wanna die

Cmaj7                        Dm7        G7
      It's not unusual to go out at any time
Cmaj7                              Dm7
      But when I see you out and about, it's such a crime
Em7                                 Dm7
      If you should ever want to be loved by anyone
G7
      It's not unusual

    C
It happens every day
   Dm7
No matter what you say
G7                                 Cmaj7
    You'll find it happens all the time
 C                  Dm7
Love will never do what you want it to
G7                   F           Em7   Eb7    Dm7    G7
    Why can't this crazy love be mine--------------------?

Cmaj7   Cmaj7   Dm7   Dm7   Cmaj7   Cmaj7   Dm7   Dm7

Cmaj7                          Dm7         G7
        It's not unusual to be mad with anyone
Cmaj7                          Dm7
        It's not unusual to be sad with anyone
Em7                                     Dm7
        But if I ever find that you've changed at any time
G7                      Cmaj7            Dm7
    It's not unusual to find that I'm in love with you

     Cmaj7         Dm7
Woah woah oh oh oh oh
     Cmaj7   Dm7     
Woah woah oh oh
     Cmaj7      Dm7
Woah woah oh oh oh oh
     Cmaj7      Dm7
Woah oh oh.....
