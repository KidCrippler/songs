F  Bb  F  Bb

F  F
     I thought I saw a man brought to life
Am
   He was warm, he came around
            Bb        
Like he was dignified.  He showed me what it was to cry
F  F                                       
     Well you couldn't be that man I adored
Am
   You don't seem to know, don't seem to care
          Bb
What your heart is for, but I don't know him anymore
        Dm
There's nothing where he used to lie 
C 
  My conversation has run dry 
Am
   That's what's going on
C                      F
  Nothing's fine, I'm torn

                C                    Dm
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                   Bb                          F
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor 
                 C                      Dm
Illusion never changed, into something real 
                   Bb                             F
I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn
                     C                 Dm        Bb
    You're a little late, I'm already torn

F  F
     So I guess the fortune teller's right
Am
   I should've seen just what was there
             Bb
and not some holy light,  but you crawl beneath my veins and now
Dm
I don't care, I have no luck
C
  I don't miss it all that much 
Am
   There's just so many things
C                          F
  That I can't touch, I'm torn

                C                    Dm
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                   Bb                          F
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor 
                 C                      Dm
Illusion never changed, into something real 
                   Bb                             F
I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn
                     C                 Dm        Bb
    You're a little late, I'm already torn

Dm           Bb
Torn...
Dm    Dm      F      C
Ooooh...   Hooooooh  ooooh...

         Dm
There's nothing where he used to lie
C
  My inspiration has run dry
Am
   That's what's going on
C                       F
  Nothing's right, I'm torn
        
                C                    Dm
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                   Bb                          F
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor 
                 C                      Dm
Illusion never changed, into something real 
                   Bb                             F
I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn
                C                    Dm
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                   Bb                               F
I'm cold and I'm ashamed, bound and broken on the floor 
                 C                 Dm         Bb
You're a little late, I'm already torn
Dm   C   C
Torn...            

(F  C  Dm  Bb) x3
