Lyrics and Music: John Legend

Em  C  G  D
Em  C  G  D

Em               Cmaj7
     What would I do without
            G
your smart mouth
           D                     Em
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
             Cmaj7
You've got my head spinning
G              D            Em
no kidding, I can't pin you down
            Cmaj7                  G
What's going on in that beautiful mind
             D               Em
I’m on your magical mystery ride
        C9
And I’m so dizzy
        G
don’t know what hit me
     D        Am9
but I’ll be alright

   Am            G
My head’s under water
     D            Am9
But I’m breathing fine
                  G             D
You’re crazy and I’m out of my mind

       G               Em9
'Cause all of me loves all of you
          Am/C
Love your curves and all your edges
         C/D           D
All your perfect imperfections
          G
Give your all to me
             Em9
I’ll give my all to you
         Am/C
You’re my end and my beginning
      C/D             D
Even when I lose I’m winning
                  Em    C      G   D9
'Cause I give you a  -  ll of me
                Em    C      G   D9
And you give me a  -  ll of you (oh)

Em           C                       G
   How many times do I have to tell you
                   D
Even when you’re crying
                  Em
you’re beautiful too
              C           G
The world is beating you down
      D                   Em
I’m around through every mood
           C                   G
You’re my downfall, you’re my muse
              D
My worst distraction
               Em
my rhythm and blues
              C             G
I can’t stop singing, it’s ringing
    D          Am
in my head for you

   Am            G
My head’s under water
     D            Am9
But I’m breathing fine
                  G             D
You’re crazy and I’m out of my mind

       G               Em9
'Cause all of me loves all of you
          Am/C
Love your curves and all your edges
         C/D           D
All your perfect imperfections
          G
Give your all to me
             Em9
I’ll give my all to you
         Am/C
You’re my end and my beginning
      C/D             D
Even when I lose I’m winning
                  Em    C      G   D9
'Cause I give you a  -  ll of me
                Em    C      G   D9
And you give me a  -  ll of you (oh)
               Am
Give me all of you

Am            G
Cards on the table
       D           Am9
we’re both showing hearts
Am         G                 D
Risking it all, though it’s hard

       G               Em9
'Cause all of me loves all of you
          Am/C
Love your curves and all your edges
         C/D           D
All your perfect imperfections
          G
Give your all to me
             Em9
I’ll give my all to you
         Am/C
You’re my end and my beginning
      C/D             D
Even when I lose I’m winning
                  Em    C      G   D9
'Cause I give you a  -  ll of me
                Em    C      G   D9
And you give me a  -  ll of you

           Em    C      G   D
I give you a  -  ll of me
                Em    C      G   D
And you give me a  -  ll of you (ohh)
