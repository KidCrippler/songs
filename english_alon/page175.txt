Open Road - Gary Barlow
Lyrics and Music: Gary Barlow
 
(Dm   G   C   F) x 4

Dm       G          C          F
My life      is extraordinary bare
Dm                   G                   C      F
       I fought the fear and chased the pain
Dm       G            C             F
My life      doesn't need to be explained
Dm                 G               C     F
       I chose to walk the line as one
Dm         G          C           F
Sometimes       as I live upon my island
Dm             G              C     F
Cut off from emotion and its pain
      Dm         G         C              F
Ohh, that's when     I am tempted by the waters
    Dm               G           C     F
The waters that can take me far away

              Dm      G                C     F
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Dm      G                 C        F
Hoping someone somewhere needs me
              Dm      G                C     F
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Dm       G               C        F
Talking to the man who knows me
         C        F             C    F
Yes he knows me,     the man is me

Dm       G              C               F
My life       was once full of peoples faces
Dm                G                  C     F
Brought to me by love which isn't strange
   Dm       G             C                F
Oh my life       had the goodness of blue waters
  Dm             G              C      F
A days a day for all I used to say
Dm         G           C              F
Sometimes       I can sit and cry my heart out
 Dm             G          C     F
Drowning in my autocratic ways
     Dm          G          C              F
Oh, that's when       I am tempted by the waters
    Dm               G           C     F
The waters that can take me far away

              Dm      G                C     F
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Dm      G                 C        F
Hoping someone somewhere needs me
              Dm      G                C     F
So I'll just keep on walking down this open road
Dm       G               C        F
Talking to the man who knows me
         C       F            C    F
Yes he knows me,   the man is me
 
(Dm   G   C   F) x 8

Dm       G            C                F
My life       is now full of people's faces
    Dm                G               C    F
Within the light of change I pulled away
   Dm        G               C           F
Oh my life       shows that no man is an island
        Dm                   G           C    F
I've exchanged the piece of life I cut away

               Dm     G                C     F
Now you won't see me walking down that open road
Dm          G               C        F
I've found someone now who needs me
               Dm     G                C     F
No, you won't see me walking down that open road
     Dm        G                 C         F
I've found at last the man who knows me
         C       F              C      F
Yes he knows me,    the man was me
            C
The man was me
