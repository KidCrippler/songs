Jolene - Dolly Parton
Lyrics and Music: Dolly Parton

Am   Am   Am   Am

  Am       C       G      Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
     G               G/E              Am     Am
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
  Am       C       G      Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
  G                   G/E             Am    Am
Please don't take him just because you  can

       Am         C
Your beauty is beyond compare
       G              Am
With flaming locks of auburn hair
     G              G/E             Am      Am
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald  green
      Am               C
Your smile is like a breath of spring
      G                 Am
Your voice is soft like summer rain
    G           G/E           Am        Am
And I cannot compete with you,   Jolene

   Am              C
He talks about you in his sleep
         G            Am
There's nothing I can do to keep
       G            G/E             Am        Am
From crying when he calls your name,   Jolene
    Am           C
And I can easily understand
     G               Am
How you could easily take my man
         G                 G/E           Am     Am
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

  Am       C       G      Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
     G               G/E              Am     Am
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
  Am       C       G      Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
  G                   G/E              Am   Am
Please don't take him just because you can

Am                    C
You could have your choice of men
    G             Am
But I could never love again
 G            G/E         Am     Am
He's the only one for me, Jolene
  Am                C
I had to have this talk with you
    G          Am
My happiness depends on you
    G          G/E           Am    Am
Whatever you decide to do, Jolene

  Am       C       G      Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
     G               G/E              Am     Am
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
  Am       C       G      Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
  G                   G/E             Am   Am
Please don't take him even though you can

Am   Am   Am   Am
