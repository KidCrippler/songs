Unbreak My Heart - Toni Braxton
Lyrics and Music: Diane Warren

/F#   Bm   Em   A   F#   G   G   F#7   F#7

Bm                 Em7
  Don't leave me in   all this pain
A
  Don't leave me out in the rain
Bm                   Em7
  Come back and bring   back my smile
          A                F#
Come and take these tears away
   Bm               Em7
I need your arms to hold me now
     A
the nights are so unkind
Bm                       Em7                   A
  Bring back those nights   when I held you beside me

A           Dm     Gm                   C
Un-break my heart, say you'll love me again
A         Dm
Undo this hurt you caused
              Gm7
When you walked out the door
           C
And walked out of my life
A             Dm          Gm            C
Un-cry these tears, I've cried so many nights
A            Bb7       A7       F#7
Un-break my heart... My  heart

Bm                  Em7
  Take back that sad   word goodbye
A
  bring back the joy to my life
Bm               Em7
  Don't leave me here with these tears
          A              F#7
Come and kiss this pain away
  Bm               Em7              A
I can't forget the day we laughed, time is so unkind
Bm                  Em                     A
  And life is so cruel without you here beside me

A           Dm     Gm                   C
Un-break my heart, say you'll love me again
A         Dm
Undo this hurt you caused
              Gm7
When you walked out the door
           C
And walked out of my life
A             Dm          Gm            C
Un-cry these tears, I've cried so many nights
A            Bb7
Un-break my heart...

Say that you love me, say that you love me, tell me you love me, un-break my
Dm                    Gm7                    C                   A
Say that you love me, say that you love me, tell me you love me, un-break my
