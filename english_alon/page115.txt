Hit The Road Jack - Ray Charles
Lyrics and Music: Percy Mayfield

Am  G  F  E  Am  G  F  E

        Am    G        F              E      Am       G        F        E
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more no more, no more, no more
        Am    G        F              E      Am   G   F        E
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more   (What you say?)
        Am    G        F              E      Am       G        F        E
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more no more, no more, no more
        Am    G        F              E      Am   G   F        E
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more

   Am         G            F           E
Oh woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
           Am           G              F     E
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
   Am       G        F    E
I guess if you said so
    Am                G         F          E
I'd have to pack my things and go (That's right)

        Am    G        F              E      Am       G        F        E
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more no more, no more, no more
        Am    G        F              E      Am   G   F        E
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more   (What you say?)
        Am    G        F              E      Am       G        F        E
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more no more, no more, no more
        Am    G        F              E      Am   G   F        E
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more

    Am            G              F              E
Now baby, listen baby, don't-a treat me this-a way
      Am       G          F         E
Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
      Am           G             F      E
Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood
          Am      G         F             E
You ain't got no money you just ain't no good
        Am       G        F    E
Well, I guess if you say so
     Am                G         F          E
I'll have to pack my things and go (That's right)

        Am    G        F              E      Am       G        F        E
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more no more, no more, no more
        Am    G        F              E      Am   G   F        E
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more   (What you say?)
        Am    G        F              E      Am       G        F        E
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more no more, no more, no more
        Am    G        F              E      Am   G
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more
 F              E      Am     G
Don't you come back no more
 F              E      Am     G
Don't you come back no more
 F              E      Am     G
Don't you come back no more
 F              E      Am
Don't you come back no more
