Imitation of Life - R.E.M
Lyrics and Music: Michael Mills, Michael Stipe, Peter Buck

Em   C   C   G   Em   Am   C - D - D4   D

Em                 Am         G         D
    Charades, pop skill water hyacinth
             Em      Am         G      D - C -
Named by a poet - imitation of life
Em         Am         G           D               Em
    Like a koi in a frozen pond, like a goldfish in a bowl
Am                G            D - C - C
 I don't want to hear you cry

        G              Em
That's sugar cane that tasted good
       Am                C     D
That's cinnamon, that's Hollywood
     G               Em               Am   C - D - D4   D
Come on, come on, no one can see you try


Em               Am              
   You want the greatest thing
      G                    D
The greatest thing since bread came sliced
Em               Am                  G     D - C -
   You've got it all, you've got it sized
Em         Am              G                    
   Like a Friday fashion show teenager
  D                Em
Freezing in the corner
 Am                  G             D - C - C - C
Trying to look like you don't try

        G              Em
That's sugar cane that tasted good
       Am                C     D
That's cinnamon, that's Hollywood
     G               Em               Am   C - D - D4   D
Come on, come on, no one can see you try

        G              Em
That's sugar cane that tasted good
         Am                    C       D
That's freezing rain, that's what you could
     G               Em               Am   C - D - D4   D
Come on, come on, no one can see you cry

      G               Em
This sugar cane, this lemonade
      Am             C     D
This hurricane, I'm not afraid
     G               Em              Am   C - D -
Come on, come on, no one can see me cry
      G                    Em
This lightning storm, this tidal wave
     Am              C     D
This avalanche, I'm not afraid
     G               Em              Am   C - D -
Come on, come on, no one can see me cry

        G              Em
That's sugar cane that tasted good
        Am                   C       D
That's who you are, that's what you could
     G               Em               Am   C - D -
Come on, come on, no one can see you cry

Come on, come on, no one can see you cry
