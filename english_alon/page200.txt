Have You Ever Seen The Rain - Creedence Clearwater Revival
Lyrics and Music: John Fogerty

Am   F/C   C   G   C   C

C
     Someone told me long ago
                                    G
There's a calm before the storm, I know
                    C
It's been coming for some time
C
     When it's over, so they say
                           G
It'll rain a sunny day, I know
                   C      C
Shining down like water

F             G
     I wanna know
         C    G/B      Am     /G
Have you ever seen the rain
F             G
     I wanna know
         C    G/B      Am    /G
Have you ever seen the rain
F            G               C      C
     Coming down on a sunny day

C
     Yesterday and days before
                                 G
Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know
                  C
Been that way for all my time
C
     'Til forever on it goes
                                     G
Through the circle fast and slow, I know
                  C
It can't stop, I wonder

F             G
     I wanna know
         C    G/B      Am     /G
Have you ever seen the rain
F             G
     I wanna know
         C    G/B      Am    /G
Have you ever seen the rain
F            G               C      C
     Coming down on a sunny day

F             G
     I wanna know
         C    G/B      Am     /G
Have you ever seen the rain
F             G
     I wanna know
         C    G/B      Am    /G
Have you ever seen the rain
F            G               C       G       C
     Coming down on a sunny day
