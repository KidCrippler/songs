     E7             C#7
Ooh, you can dance, you can jive
F#m                      B
Having the time of your life
      D             Bm
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
             A             D      A      D
Digging the dancing queen

  A                                 D
Friday night and the lights are low
 A                            F#m
Looking out for a place to go
  E
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
             E   F#m          E  -  F#m     -  F#m
You come to look for a king

A                         D
Anybody could be that guy
 A                             F#m
Night is young and the music's high
E
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
               E   F#m          E  -  F#m     -  F#m
You're in the mood for a dance
             Bm             E
And when you get the chance

             A
You are the dancing queen
 D                     A         D
Young and sweet, only seventeen
 A
Dancing queen
 D                      A
Feel the beat from the tambourine
     D
Oh, yeah

     E7             C#7
Ooh, you can dance, you can jive
F#m                      B
Having the time of your life
      D             Bm
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
             A             D      A      D
Digging the dancing queen

A    A   -   D   -

 A                               D
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
 A                                 F#m
Leave them burning and then you're gone
 E
Looking out for another, anyone will do
               E   F#m          E  -  F#m     -  F#m
You're in the mood for a dance
             Bm             E
And when you get the chance

             A
You are the dancing queen
 D                     A         D
Young and sweet, only seventeen
 A
Dancing queen
 D                      A
Feel the beat from the tambourine
     D
Oh, yeah

     E7             C#7
Ooh, you can dance, you can jive
F#m                      B
Having the time of your life
      D             Bm
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
             A             D      A      D
Digging the dancing queen
             A             D      A      D
Digging the dancing queen
