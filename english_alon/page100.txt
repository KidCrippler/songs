Show me The Meaning of Being Lonely - Backstreet Boys
Lyrics and Music: Herbie Crichlow & Max Martin

Em                         C     D
   Show me the meaning of being lonely

Em  Em  C  D

Em                        C      D
   So many words for the broken heart
Em                         C      D
   It's hard to see in a crimson love
    D       C                 B
So hard to breathe, walk with me, and maybe
Em                     C      D
   Nights of light so soon become
Em                        C        D
   Wild and free I could feel the sun
     D      C            B
Your every wish will be done, they tell me...

Em                         C     D
   Show me the meaning of being lonely
Em                        C       D
   Is this the feeling I need to walk with
G                 B                       Em
   Tell me why I can't be there where you are
         C                D
There's something missing in my heart

Em  Em  C  D

Em                     C    D
   Life goes on as it never ends
Em                  C          D
   Eyes of stone observe the trends
      D     C           B
They never say forever gaze if only
Em                    C        D   
   Guilty roads to an endless love
Em                              C       D
   There's no control, are you with me now
     D      C       B
Your every wish will be done, they tell me

Em                         C     D
   Show me the meaning of being lonely
Em                        C       D
   Is this the feeling I need to walk with
G                 B                       Em
   Tell me why I can't be there where you are
         C                D
There's something missing in my...

 F#m                        D
(Heart) There's nowhere to run
       E           F#m
I have no place to go
              D      E        A
Surrender my heart, body and soul
                            C#
How can it be you're asking me to feel
                      F#m  D E F#m
the things you never show oooooohh
