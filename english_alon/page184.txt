Lemon Tree - Fool's Garden
Lyrics and Music: Peter Freudenthaler and Volker Hinkel

Em   Bm   Em   Bm   Am   Bm   Em   [Em]   []

    Em                Bm
I'm sitting here in a boring room
     Em                        Bm
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
    Em                     Bm
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do
    Em                  Bm
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you
    Am                    Bm         Em      [Em]
But nothing ever happens   -   and I wonder

     Em            Bm
I'm driving around in my car
     Em                    Bm
I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far
    Em                Bm
I'd like to change my point of view
   Em                 Bm
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
    Am                    Bm         Em      [Em]
But nothing ever happens   -   and I wonder

   G             D
I wonder how, I wonder why
Em                               Bm
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    C               D                    G           D7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
     G              D
I'm turning my head up and down
    Em                              Bm
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
    C              C#o7                 D
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree

D7    Em
Sing: da
Bm              Em
    Da da da da di da da
Bm              Am
    Da da da da di da da
Bm            Em   [Em]
    Da deedly da

    Em              Bm
I'm sitting here, I miss the power
    Em              Bm
I'd like to go out, taking a shower
     Em                     Bm
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
   Em                  Bm
I feel so tired, put myself into bed
      Am                     Bm        Em      [Em]
Where nothing ever happens    -  and I wonder

B             Em
    Isolation is not good for me
D              G                 B
    Isolation, I don't want to       sit on a lemon tree

     Em                  Bm
I'm stepping around in a desert of joy
Em                     Bm
Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy
    Am                      Bm               Em      [Em]
And everything will happen   -    and you'll wonder

   G             D
I wonder how, I wonder why
Em                               Bm
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    C               D                    G           D7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
     G              D
I'm turning my head up and down
    Em                              Bm
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
    C              C#o7                 D
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
       D7
(yet I wonder, wonder)

   G             D
I wonder how, I wonder why
Em                               Bm
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    C               D       C               D
And all that I can see, and all that I can see
    C               D                    G
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
