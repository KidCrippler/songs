            D        G               D
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary
              D/F#      G                 A   -   A4   -   A
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
             Bm        G              D       G
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence
           D        A              D
Until you come and sit awhile with me

             Bm     G               D            A
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
             Bm      G              D         A
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
       Bm         G             D         G
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders
             D      A              D
You raise me up to more than I can be
