POLICE - ROXANNE


{Verse 1}
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right

{Pre-Chorus}
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

{Chorus}
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light
(Roxanne) Put on the red light

Oh
