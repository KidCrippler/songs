They try to make me go to rehab, I say no no no

Yes, I've been black but when I come back you'll know, know, know

I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
C                           F              C

E                     Am

I ain’t got seventy days
E                                              Am
Cos there’s nothing, there's nothing you can’t teach me
F                       Ab
That I can’t learn from Mr Hathaway
G
I didn’t get a lot in class
      F
But I know it don’t come in a shot glass

I said I got no idea
E                            Am
I’m gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
F                  Ab
So I always keep a bottle near

I don’t ever want to drink again
F                  Ab
I just, ooh I just need a friend
E                   Am
I’m not gonna spend ten weeks
F                           Ab
And have everyone think I’m on the mend 
G
And it’s not just my pride
F
It’s just 'til these tears have dried
