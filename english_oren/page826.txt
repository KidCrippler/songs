Nirvana - come as you are


Come as you are, as you were,
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend, as an old enemy.
Take your time, hurry up
The choice is yours, don't be late.
Take a rest, as a friend, as an old enemy

Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend, as an old enemy

Memoria

When I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun

Memoria - no I don't have a gun

When I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
