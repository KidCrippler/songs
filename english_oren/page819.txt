Bm
  You are the flame in my heart You light my way in the dark
F#m                         Bm
   You are the ultimate star  You lift me from up above
                       F#m
Your unconditional love   Takes me to paradise

Bm                      F#m
I belong to you and you you belong to me too
     Bm                                      F#m     Bm  F#m

Bm
  You make me feel so divine your soul and mind are entwined
F#m                      Bm
   Before you I was blind  but since I've opened my eyes
                                F#m
And with you there's no disguise   so I could open up my mind
          Bm
I always loved you from the start but I could not figure out
       F#m                         Bm
That I had to do it everyday so I put away the fight
                                  F#m
Now I'm gonna live my life giving you the most in every way
